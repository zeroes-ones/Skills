# Scrum Master

Agile delivery leadership system for guiding Scrum teams from forming through high-performance. Covers all Scrum ceremonies, metrics-driven continuous improvement, impediment removal, and scaling frameworks.

## Route the Request
<!-- QUICK: 30s -- pick your path, skip the rest -->

What are you trying to do?

└── Don't know where to start? → Start at "Sprint Facilitation"

**Do not read the entire skill.** Follow the route above and read only the sections it points to.

## Ground Rules — Read Before Anything Else

These rules apply to *every* response this skill produces.

- **Never estimate for the team.** Estimates come from the people doing the work, never from the scrum master.
- **Retrospective action items need owners and deadlines.** Action items without accountability don't get done.
- **Velocity is for planning, not performance evaluation.** Using velocity to compare teams or individuals destroys trust.
- **The scrum master serves the team, not manages it.** Facilitate, coach, and remove impediments — don't assign work.
- **Always surface impediments early.** A blocked team member for 2 days is a sprint risk.
- **Admit what you don't know.** If a scaling framework (LeSS/Nexus/SAFe) is unfamiliar territory, say so.

## When to Use
<!-- QUICK: 30s -- scan the bullet list to decide if this skill fits -->
- Establishing or resetting Scrum practices for a new or underperforming team
- Coaching a team through sprint planning — effective story decomposition, estimation, sprint goal crafting
- Facilitating retrospectives that produce actionable, tracked improvement experiments
- Diagnosing delivery bottlenecks through agile metrics: velocity variance, cycle time, cumulative flow, escaped defects
- Protecting the team from external interference while maintaining stakeholder transparency
- Scaling Scrum across multiple teams with LeSS, SAFe, or Nexus
- Onboarding a team to Scrum from waterfall or ad-hoc processes
- Improving Product Owner and Development Team collaboration on backlog health and refinement
- **Use `/project-manager` instead** when: You need project planning with WBS, Gantt charts, RAID logs, budget tracking, stakeholder reporting, or a formal project charter. Project-manager handles the *what and when* — scope, timeline, budget, risks. Scrum-master handles the *how* — team process, coaching, impediment removal.
- **Use `/technical-program-manager` instead** when: A program spans multiple scrum teams, has cross-team dependencies, and requires a consolidated timeline and risk register. TPM coordinates across teams; scrum-master serves one team.

```
**When to choose Scrum:** Predictable batched work, team needs regular alignment — full ceremonies (sprint planning, daily scrum, review, retro), 2-week cadence, defined sprint goal.
**When to choose Kanban:** Continuous inflow (support tickets, ops), no natural sprint boundary — WIP limits, cycle time, cumulative flow diagram (CFD), no fixed iterations.
**When to choose Scrumban:** Mix of planned features + unplanned work — retain sprint structure with WIP limits, fewer ceremonies, use CFD + burndown metrics.

```
**When to choose 1-week:** Experienced team, volatile requirements, fast feedback needed — cost: ceremony overhead ~15% of sprint time.
**When to choose 2-week:** Default for most teams — balances feedback frequency with ceremony overhead (~10%), validates assumptions every 10 business days.
**When to choose 3-4 week:** New Scrum team or inherently complex work (research spikes, deep technical design) — more time to produce meaningful increment, less ceremony overhead.

                                           └────────┘
```
**When to implement action tracking:** Same issues recurring — create visible action board with owner + deadline per item, review at start of each retro, escalate if >2 sprints stale.
**When to escalate:** Issues are systemic/organizational — team can't fix alone. Escalate with data (e.g., "3 sprints blocked by procurement SLAs").
**When to change format:** Disengagement — try silent writing, start-stop-continue, 4Ls (liked/learned/lacked/longed), or 1-on-1 check-ins to rebuild psychological safety.

```
**When team self-resolves:** Impediment within team's span of control — SM observes and coaches but doesn't do it for them. Builds team autonomy.
**When SM facilitates cross-team:** Dependency on another team — SM schedules and facilitates resolution meeting, tracks action items, follows up daily.
**When SM escalates to leadership:** Organizational blocker (procurement, hiring, policy) — SM escalates with quantified business impact data, not just frustration.

### Scaling Framework Selection (LeSS vs SAFe vs Nexus)

```
**When to choose LeSS/Nexus:** Single product, 2-9 teams, co-located — LeSS (minimalist), Nexus (Scrum.org). Keep it simple; avoid SAFe overhead for single product.
**When to choose SAFe:** Enterprise with 5+ teams across multiple products/programs, need portfolio management, compliance, executive visibility — ART, PI Planning, RTE role.
**When to choose Scrum of Scrums:** 3-5 teams, no enterprise governance needed — lightweight coordination with ambassador from each team meeting 2-3×/week.

## Core Workflow
<!-- QUICK: 30s -- scan phase titles to understand the process -->
<!-- DEEP: 10+min -->
### Phase 1 (~15 min): Team Formation & Foundations

1. **Team Chartering** — Purpose, norms, Definition of Ready (DoR), Definition of Done (DoD), roles clarified.
2. **Backlog Establishment** — User story format, ordered by value (WSJF for complex prioritization), relative sizing (Fibonacci), top 2-3 sprints refined.
3. **Sprint Cadence** — 2 weeks standard. Fixed ceremony schedule. Protect the rhythm.

<!-- DEEP: 10+min -->
### Phase 2 (~30 min): Ceremony Facilitation

1. **Sprint Planning** (4hr for 2-week sprint) — What: PO presents sprint goal, team pulls PBIs. How: decompose PBIs into tasks (≤8hrs each). Commit to sprint goal, not individual PBIs.
2. **Daily Scrum** (15 min) — Team coordination, not status report. Walk board right-to-left.
3. **Backlog Refinement** (10% of capacity) — Weekly. Review, split, estimate, add acceptance criteria.
4. **Sprint Review** (1hr/week of sprint) — Collaborative inspection of increment + backlog adaptation.
5. **Sprint Retrospective** (1.5hr for 2-week sprint) — Gather data → generate insights → decide 1-3 improvement experiments → close.

<!-- DEEP: 10+min -->
### Phase 3 (~20 min): Metrics, Impediments & Scaling

1. **Agile Metrics** — Velocity (3-sprint rolling avg), Sprint Burndown, Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD), Cycle Time, Escaped Defects, Team Health, Sprint Goal Success Rate.
2. **Impediment Removal** — External and internal impediments. Maintain impediment log. Track resolution time.
3. **Scaling** — Nexus (3-9 teams), LeSS (up to 8 teams, single backlog), SAFe (if organizational mandate). Goal: minimize cross-team dependencies.

## Best Practices
<!-- STANDARD: 3min -- rules extracted from production experience -->
- The Scrum Master is a coach, not a secretary. Teach, don't do.
- Sprint goals, not sprint backlogs, are the commitment.
- Protect the retrospective — never cancel it.
- WIP limits reduce cycle time: WIP = team size / 2.
- Velocity is for team forecasting, not management performance review.
- Daily scrum is team-to-team coordination, not status report to SM/PO.
- Healthy backlog has top 2-3 sprints refined to task level.

## MVP vs Growth vs Scale

| Phase | Team Size | Priority | Scrum Approach |
|-------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| **MVP (0→1)** | 1-3 devs | Ship fast, learn faster | Kanban over Scrum. 1-week cycles. No formal ceremonies — async standup in Slack. Retro = 15 min at end of cycle. DoD: "deployed + doesn't crash." No story points — just break work into small tasks. |
| **Growth (1→10)** | 3-15 devs, SM may be rotating role or tech lead | Predictability + continuous improvement | Full Scrum: 2-week sprints, all ceremonies timeboxed, story points + velocity, backlog refinement weekly, retros with action items. |
| **Scale (10→N)** | 15+ devs, dedicated SMs (1 per 1-2 teams) | Cross-team alignment, scaling | Scaling framework (Nexus/LeSS/SAFe). Scrum of Scrums, cross-team refinement, integrated increment, shared DoD. Program-level metrics. |

**MVP rule:** Don't Scrum before you need it. A team of 3 doing daily standups, sprint planning, reviews, and retros for a 1-week cycle is ceremony overhead eating 20% of dev time. Kanban + 1 retro/week is enough.

| Scrum board | GitHub Projects / Linear (free) / Trello (free) | Jira Software ($7.75/user/mo) | >10 people, need advanced reporting, or enterprise requirements |
| Retrospectives | Google Docs + Miro free (3 boards) | Miro Team ($8/user/mo) or Parabol ($6/user/mo) | Remote team >5 or need structured retro formats with voting |
| Sprint reports | Jira/GitHub built-in velocity chart (free) | ActionableAgile ($15/user/mo) | Need CFD, Monte Carlo forecasting, or flow metrics |
| Agile coaching | Internal champion reads Scrum Guide + blogs | Professional coach ($150-300/hr) | Team stuck, persistent dysfunction, or scaling to 3+ teams |
| Team health | Google Forms pulse survey, 1 question | Officevibe ($4/user/mo) or CultureAmp | >3 teams or need anonymized trend data |

**Annual Scrum tool budget by phase:** MVP: $0. Growth: $500-5K. Scale: $10K-100K.

## Scalability Decision Tree

```
Is your team size >7 people?
├── YES → Split into 2 teams. Optimal size: 5-7. Don't scale one team to 12.
└── NO → Single team is fine.

Are sprints consistently finishing with >30% carryover?
├── YES → <!-- DEEP: 10+min -->
Root cause: overcommitment? scope creep? unplanned work? Fix the cause.
└── NO → Carryover <20% is healthy.

Is velocity variance >30% sprint-over-sprint?
├── YES → Inconsistent sizing, team changes, scope changes. Stabilize.
└── NO → Stable enough for forecasting. Use 3-sprint rolling average.

Is cycle time >5 days for "ready to done" on average?
├── YES → Bottleneck. Check CFD. Apply WIP limits at constraint.
└── NO → Cycle time is healthy.

Are retro action items being completed?
├── YES → Improvement loop working.
└── NO → Reduce to 1 action item. Track visibly. Build the habit.

Do you have >3 teams on the SAME product?
├── YES → Cross-team coordination needed. Nexus or LeSS. Single Product Backlog.
└── NO → No scaling framework needed.
```


**What good looks like:** Team velocity tracked for 5+ sprints with predictable range. Sprint goal achieved in 8 of 10 sprints. Retro produces action items tracked to completion. Impediments removed within 24 hours. Team health score > 4/5 in retro survey.

## When NOT to Use This Skill (Overkill)

- **Solo developer or pair programming**: Scrum for 1-2 people is absurd. Use Kanban.
- **Team of 3 building an MVP in 2 weeks**: Ceremonies consume more time than they save. Async check-ins. Skip planning. 1 retro at the end.
- **Pure operations/support team (no development)**: Scrum is for complex product development. Ops teams do better with Kanban.
- **Research team with unpredictable work**: Sprints assume you can estimate. If you can't, use Kanban with explicit policies.
- **Team already high-performing with a different process (Shape Up, Kanban, XP)**: Don't "fix" what works. The goal is delivering value, not doing Scrum.

## Token-Efficient Workflow

```
# Step 1: Sprint health check (query from issue tracker API)
python3 scripts/sprint_health.py --team backend --output json
# Returns: {"sprint":"W15","committed":34,"completed":28,"carryover":6,
#           "velocity_3sprint_avg":31,"cycle_time_p85":4.2,"retro_items_done":2}

# Step 2: Decision tree → action
# carryover > 20% → Overcommitted. Reduce commitment by average carryover.
# cycle_time_p85 > 5 days → Check CFD for bottleneck. Apply WIP limit.
# retro_items_done == 0 → Retros need focus. Pick 1 action. Track.

# Step 3: Generate retrospective data (pull metrics before retro)
python3 scripts/retro_data.py --team backend --sprint 15 --output markdown

# Step 4: Verify improvement
python3 scripts/sprint_health.py --team backend --compare-sprint 14 --output json
# Exit code 0 = metrics improved, 1 = worsened
```

**Principle:** `sprint_health.py` queries Linear/Jira API, returns JSON. Agent reads numbers, not narratives. Retro data auto-generated. Improvement tracked via exit codes.

## Cross-Skill Coordination
<!-- QUICK: 30s -- table of who to talk to when -->
The Scrum Master is a servant-leader who enables the team, removes impediments, and facilitates agile ceremonies. Coordination is about protecting the team while keeping stakeholders informed.

### Decision Gates & Artifacts

- **Sprint Planning Readiness Gate**: Backlog refined (top 2-3 sprints at task level), Definition of Ready met for all PBIs, team capacity calculated, sprint goal drafted. Output: sprint backlog with committed PBIs and task breakdown.
- **Definition of Done (DoD) Gate**: No PBI marked "Done" without meeting all DoD criteria (code reviewed, tested, deployed, documented, accepted). Output: working increment that passes all quality gates.
- **Retrospective Action Tracking Gate**: Every retro produces 1-3 improvement experiments with owners and deadlines. Action items not completed within 2 sprints trigger escalation. Output: tracked action item board with completion status.
- **Impediment Escalation Gate**: Impediment not resolved within 24 hours escalates to `engineering-manager` or `project-manager`. Organizational blockers escalate to leadership with quantified business impact data. Output: impediment log with resolution time tracked.
- **Velocity Health Gate**: Velocity drops >30% for 2 consecutive sprints triggers root cause investigation with `product-manager`, `engineering-manager`, and `project-manager`. Output: sprint health diagnostic report.
- **Team Health Gate**: Health check metric collected each sprint. Two consecutive declines trigger intervention with `engineering-manager` and HR/People Ops. Output: team health trend report with intervention plan.

| Coordinate With | When | What to Share/Ask |
|-----------------|------|-------------------|
| **Product Owner / Product Strategist** | Backlog refinement, sprint planning, stakeholder alignment | Sprint goals, backlog health, velocity trends, value delivery metrics |
| **Project Manager** | Cross-team dependencies, timeline expectations, resource changes | Impediments spanning multiple teams, delivery forecasts, capacity changes |
| **Engineering Lead / Tech Lead** | Technical debt, architecture decisions, engineering practices | Tech debt backlog, refactoring needs, pairing/mentoring, code quality metrics |
| **UX Designer** | Sprint readiness, design handoff, usability testing | Design-ready stories before sprint start, research findings integration |
| **QA Engineer** | Definition of Done, test automation, regression strategy | Done criteria adherence, test coverage trends, defect patterns |
| **DevOps / Platform Team** | CI/CD pipeline health, deployment cadence, environment availability | Pipeline failures, deployment blockers, environment provisioning |
| **Other Scrum Masters** | Cross-team coordination, Scrum of Scrums, dependency management | Team dependencies, shared impediments, agile practice alignment |
| **HR / People Ops** | Team health, conflict resolution, professional development | Team morale signals, skill gaps, training needs, interpersonal dynamics |
| **Security Reviewer** | Security requirements in Definition of Done | Security acceptance criteria, threat modeling participation |

### Communication Triggers — When to Proactively Notify

| Trigger | Notify | Why |
|---------|--------|-----|
| Sprint goal at risk (mid-sprint) | Product Owner, Project Manager, Stakeholders | Early expectation management; scope negotiation possible |
| Blocked impediment not resolved in 24 hours | Engineering Lead, Project Manager | Escalation needed; team throughput affected |
| Team velocity drops by >30% for 2 consecutive sprints | Product Owner, Engineering Lead, Project Manager | Systemic issue; root cause investigation required |
| Team health check shows declining trend (2+ consecutive drops) | Engineering Lead, HR/People Ops | Burnout, conflict, or disengagement risk; intervention needed |
| Inter-team dependency not met by commitment date | Other Scrum Master, Project Manager | Downstream sprint impact; escalation to dependency owner |
| Definition of Done not met for >20% of sprint items | Product Owner, Engineering Lead, QA | Quality crisis; root cause in estimation, skills, or technical debt |
| Retrospective action items not completed 2 sprints in a row | Engineering Lead, Team | Continuous improvement credibility at risk; process trust erodes |
| Stakeholder bypassing Scrum process (direct task assignment to devs) | Product Owner, Project Manager | Process integrity; undermines sprint commitment and prioritization |

### Escalation Path

| Situation | Escalate To | Rationale |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Team dysfunction or interpersonal conflict affecting delivery >2 sprints | **Engineering Lead** + HR/People Ops | Mediation or team composition change needed; beyond Scrum Master facilitation |
| Product Owner unavailable or unresponsive for >1 sprint | **Product Strategist** + Project Manager | Backlog unrefined; team cannot plan without PO engagement |
| Organizational impediment blocking team (budget, procurement, policy) | **CTO Advisor** or VP Engineering + Project Manager | Authority beyond team level; systemic blocker |
| Agile transformation resistance from senior leadership | **Agile Coach** (external) + CTO Advisor | Cultural change requires executive sponsorship |
| Team consistently over-committing and burning out (utilization >110% for 4+ sprints) | **Engineering Lead** + HR + Project Manager | Sustainability crisis; capacity protection needed |

### Route to Other Skills

| If the Request Involves | Route To | Rationale |
|--------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Project planning with WBS, Gantt charts, RAID logs | `project-manager` | PM handles the *what and when* — scope, timeline, budget, risks |
| Multi-team program coordination and consolidated timelines | `technical-program-manager` | TPM coordinates across teams; SM serves one team |
| Product backlog prioritization and stakeholder alignment | `product-manager` | Product owns backlog ordering and value delivery |
| Engineering capacity planning and technical debt strategy | `engineering-manager` | Resource allocation and engineering practices decisions |
| Definition of Done enforcement and quality metrics | `qa-engineer` | QA validates sprint output against DoD criteria |
| Organizational impediment (procurement, policy, budget) | `cto-advisor` or `vp-engineering` | Authority beyond team level; systemic blocker |
| Agile transformation resistance from leadership | `agile-coach` (external) + `cto-advisor` | Cultural change requires executive sponsorship |

## Scale Depth

### Solo (1 person, 0-100 users)
One Scrum Master serving 1 team part-time (often a developer wearing SM hat). Ceremonies: daily scrum (15 min), sprint planning (2 hours/biweekly), review + retro (1.5 hours combined). Backlog: Product Owner manages in Jira/Linear. No formal scaling needed. Metrics: velocity (basic), sprint burndown. SM focuses on facilitation + impediment removal, light coaching. Cost: $0-200/month (Jira/Linear). Overkill: SAFe, LeSS, Nexus, dedicated SM, agile coaching, portfolio Kanban.

### Small (2-10 people, 100-10K users)
Dedicated Scrum Master for 1-2 teams. Ceremonies standardized with team working agreements. Metrics: velocity, sprint burndown, cycle time, escaped defects. Retrospectives produce tracked action items. Sprint goal consistently achieved (>70% sprint success rate). SM coaches PO on backlog refinement. Cost: $200-1K/month. Overkill: scaling framework, release train, PI Planning.

### Medium (10-50 people, 10K-1M users)
2-3 Scrum Masters or Agile Coaches. Scaling: LeSS or Nexus for 3-8 teams on same product. Metrics: cumulative flow, throughput, lead time, defect density. Cross-team dependency management via Scrum of Scrums. SM community of practice. Agile health assessments (Spotify Squad Health Check). SM coaches leadership on agile principles. Cost: $2K-10K/month. Overkill: SAFe unless enterprise governance demands it.

### Enterprise (50+ people, 10K+ users)
Agile Coaches + Scrum Masters across multiple ARTs (SAFe) or product groups. Release Train Engineer (RTE) for PI Planning. Enterprise agile metrics: flow efficiency, time-to-market, employee NPS. Portfolio Kanban linking strategy to execution. Center of Excellence for agile practices. Value stream mapping. Cost: $20K-150K+/month.

### Transition Triggers
| From → To | Trigger | What to Change |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Solo → Small | 2+ teams needing SM, or sprint success rate <60% | Dedicate SM; standardize ceremonies; implement action tracking from retros |
| Small → Medium | 3+ teams on same product, cross-team dependencies blocking sprints | Adopt LeSS/Nexus; implement Scrum of Scrums; add agile health assessments |
| Medium → Enterprise | 5+ products, portfolio governance required, or 50+ developers | Adopt SAFe (if enterprise); add RTE role; implement portfolio Kanban; establish CoE |


### Cross-skills Integration

| Step | Skill | What it produces |
|------|-------|------------------|
| **Before** | project-manager | Project schedule, RAID log, milestone plan, resource allocation |
| **This** | scrum-master | Sprint plans, retrospectives, backlog refinement, velocity metrics |
| **After** | backend-developer | Working software increments delivered each sprint |

Common chains:
- **Chain**: project-manager → scrum-master → backend-developer — Project plan broken into sprints; the team delivers working increments.
- **Chain**: product-manager → scrum-master → qa-engineer — Backlog priorities become sprint goals; QA validates the sprint output.

## What Good Looks Like

> When scrum mastery is at its peak, sprint goals are clear and the team delivers a working increment every sprint, retrospectives produce actionable improvements that are implemented in the next sprint, the backlog is refined so that the top items are always ready for execution, impediments are removed before the team feels the friction, velocity is predictable within a range, and the team's morale and autonomy grow quarter over quarter — the scrum master's success is measured by how little the team needs them.

## Sub-Skills

| Sub-Skill | When to Use | Context |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Sprint Facilitation** | Running sprint planning, daily scrum, review, and retrospective | Time-boxed facilitation, sprint goal crafting, capacity-based planning, visual boards (Miro, Jira) |
| **Backlog Refinement Coaching** | Backlog >2 sprints deep, stories lack clear acceptance criteria, or PO overwhelmed | INVEST criteria, story splitting patterns, 3-amigos sessions, estimation (story points, t-shirt sizing) |
| **Agile Metrics & Diagnostics** | Diagnosing delivery bottlenecks or reporting team health | Velocity trend, CFD, cycle time, throughput, escaped defects, sprint burndown — Jira, Linear, ActionableAgile |
| **Impediment Removal** | Systematic blockers slowing team velocity | Impediment log, escalation paths, cross-team facilitation, organizational blocker quantification in business impact |
| **Team Health & Psychological Safety** | Team engagement declining, conflict surfacing, or turnover rising | Retrospective formats (4Ls, sailboat, start-stop-continue), health checks, 1-on-1s, conflict mediation |
| **Scaling Scrum (LeSS/Nexus/SAFe)** | 3+ teams on same product or multi-team coordination needed | LeSS (2-8 teams, single product), Nexus (3-9 teams), SAFe (enterprise, 5+ products, PI Planning) |
| **Agile Transformation Coaching** | Organization transitioning from waterfall or ad-hoc to agile | Change management, leadership coaching, agile principles over practices, pilot teams, metrics-driven adoption |
| **DoR/DoD Facilitation** | Quality issues from unclear readiness or completion criteria | Definition of Ready (DoR) checklist, Definition of Done (DoD) with quality gates, team agreement, PO + team alignment |

### Error Decoder

| Symptom | Root Cause | Fix | Lesson |
|---------|------------|-----|--------|
| Same issues surface every retrospective -- Groundhog Day retro syndrome | Retro action items are documented but never tracked -- no owner, no deadline, no follow-through | Create a retro action board visible to the entire team. Each retro produces 1-3 action items with named owners and a deadline. First item of every retro: review previous action items. | A retro without tracked action items is a complaint session. If nothing changes after the retro, the team will stop participating. Action items with accountability are the only output that matters. |
| Sprint goal missed 6 of the last 8 sprints despite team completing all committed story points | Team committed to individual PBIs (stories) but had no sprint goal -- each PBI was independent, and the team had no coherent objective | Introduce sprint goals: one sentence describing what the team will achieve together. All PBIs should contribute to the goal. Measure goal achievement, not story point completion. | A sprint without a goal is just two weeks of tasks. Story points measure output, not outcome. The sprint goal creates alignment and gives the team a reason to collaborate, not just divide and conquer. |
| Daily standup has become a 30-minute status report to the Scrum Master | SM proactively asks "what did you do yesterday?" going around the room -- team members passively report to the SM instead of coordinating with each other | Flip the format: team members walk the board from right to left (Done to In Progress to To Do). Each person addresses the team, not the SM. SM only speaks to remove impediments. | When the standup faces the Scrum Master, it is a status meeting. When it faces the board, it is a coordination meeting. The SM's job is to make themselves invisible in the standup. |
| Product Owner has been unavailable for backlog refinement for 3 sprints -- team is building without direction | PO is over-tasked across multiple teams, and the team has been self-prioritizing from an unrefined backlog | Escalate PO unavailability to the engineering manager and product leadership. Use the available time to refine the backlog with the team's best understanding. Invite a stakeholder proxy if needed. | A team without an available PO will self-prioritize, and that prioritization will not match the business goals. Unavailability of the PO is an impediment -- escalate it like one. |
| Velocity has been declining for 3 sprints, and the team is demoralized | Management started using velocity as a performance metric -- team members are padding estimates and hiding capacity to avoid looking slow | Make velocity data visible only to the team for sprint planning. Report outcomes (sprint goal achievement, business impact) to management, not velocity. Rebuild trust through blameless retros. | Velocity is a planning tool, not a management report card. When velocity becomes a performance metric, teams game it. Protect the team from metric misuse -- your job is to be the shield. |
