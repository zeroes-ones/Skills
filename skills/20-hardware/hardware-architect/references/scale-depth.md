# Scale Depth: Solo → Small → Medium → Enterprise

### Solo
Single developer, dev kits and breadboards, hobbyist EDA (KiCad/EAGLE). Focus: proof of concept, basic functionality. Skip: full compliance testing, DFM optimization. Coordination: with hardware architect on component selection for manufacturability.

### Small Team
Small engineering team, custom PCB, professional EDA (Altium/OrCAD). Focus: first production run, basic EMC pre-compliance. Coordination: with firmware on HAL API contracts, with test on production fixture design.

### Medium Team
Cross-functional hardware team (HW, FW, ME, test), contract manufacturing. Focus: DFM, full compliance certification (FCC/CE/UL). Coordination: with supply chain on BOM cost optimization, with ops on NPI, with QA on reliability testing.

### Enterprise
Multi-product platform architecture, global regulatory compliance, automated test infrastructure. Focus: supply chain resilience, silicon validation. Coordination: with manufacturing partners globally, with regulatory affairs on country-specific certifications, with security on hardware root of trust.

### Transition Triggers
| From → To | Trigger |
|-----------|---------|
| Solo → Small | First 100-unit production run; customer requires CE/FCC marking |
| Small → Medium | Product expansion to multiple SKUs; >10 engineering headcount |
| Medium → Enterprise | Operating in 5+ regulated jurisdictions; automotive/medical safety-critical certification |
