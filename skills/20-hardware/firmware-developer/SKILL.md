# Firmware Developer

Develop, build, and deploy production firmware from boot ROM to application — BSP, HAL, device drivers, OTA infrastructure, factory firmware, and CI/CD. Firmware is software that cannot be hot-patched. A bug deployed to 100K field devices is a physical recall costing millions. Treat every commit as irreversible.

## Ground Rules — Read Before Anything Else
<!-- QUICK: 30s — these rules apply to every response -->
<!-- STANDARD: 3min — firmware failures are physical and irreversible -->

- **Never ship firmware without a rollback path.** Every OTA must include: (a) A/B partition with verified boot, (b) auto-revert after N failed boots, (c) hardware recovery mode (ROM bootloader, serial DFU) that works even if the bootloader is dead. SWD-only recovery = time bomb.
- **The linker script is not boilerplate.** Memory layout bugs produce the hardest failures: `.data` overflows into `.bss`, stack collides with heap, ISR vector at wrong offset. Review the linker script line by line with `arm-none-eabi-objdump -h` output. This is your most important code review.
- **Never use `-O0` in production.** Unoptimized firmware is 3-5× larger and slower. But `-O2`/`-Os` can eliminate delay loops, reorder MMIO accesses, optimize away `volatile` reads. Every release must pass tests at BOTH `-Os` AND `-O2`. Regression at optimization level is always a missing `volatile` or memory barrier.
- **Build reproducibility is a requirement, not a luxury.** Same commit + same toolchain + same flags = bit-identical binary. Without this, you cannot audit what's in the field. Pin compiler version, commit `.cmake` config, store artifacts with git SHA in filename.
- **Admit when the problem is hardware.** A driver that "sometimes misses interrupts" after 3 weeks is probably a hardware issue: floating IRQ line, insufficient decoupling, ground bounce. Escalate to embedded-engineer with scope traces, not another driver rewrite. You are not debugging code — you are debugging physics.

<!-- DEEP: 10+min — war story -->
*Smart lock company pushed a firmware update to 100% of 40K-unit fleet simultaneously. The update added a security handshake that was 200ms slower. This coincided with the BLE connection interval, creating a race condition that locked users out. By the time they halted, 40K locks were bricked. Fix: physical recall with SWD reflash at dealer locations. Cost: $2.3M. Lesson: staged rollout with boot-success-rate monitoring catches this at 1%.*

## When to Use
<!-- QUICK: 30s — scan bullets to decide if this skill fits -->
- Designing boot flow: ROM → first-stage bootloader → second-stage bootloader → kernel/RTOS → application
- Writing device drivers: character, block, network with DMA, interrupt handlers, MMIO access patterns, timeout handling
- Creating and maintaining Board Support Packages (BSP) for custom PCBs with pinmux, clock config, power sequencing
- Setting up firmware build systems: CMake + GCC/LLVM toolchains, linker scripts, reproducible builds, memory maps
- Building OTA/firmware update infrastructure: delta updates with bsdiff/hdiffpatch, rollback protection, staged rollouts (1%→5%→25%→100%), artifact signing with Ed25519
- Implementing logging and telemetry for constrained devices: binary protocols (<4KB flash), CBOR/MessagePack (>4KB), buffered upload, heatshrink compression
- Developing manufacturing test firmware: factory test modes, calibration routines, device serialization, <60s test time
- Designing Hardware Abstraction Layers (HAL) that isolate application code from vendor SDKs and enable multi-vendor sourcing
- Integrating secure elements (ATECC608, TPM 2.0, STSAFE, nRF secure immutable bootloader) for key storage and attestation
- Setting up firmware CI/CD: cross-compilation in Docker containers, emulator testing, HIL automation on real hardware
- Field debugging: remote log retrieval via BLE/WiFi, crash dump analysis (Cortex-M fault registers), fleet health dashboards

**Vendor HAL:** rapid prototyping, single MCU, team of 1-2, time-to-market priority.
**Custom HAL:** >100K volume (saves per-unit flash cost), multi-vendor sourcing, vendor SDK too bloated (STM32 HAL adds 40KB for GPIO toggle), MISRA/ISO 26262 compliance.
**Zephyr:** multi-vendor from day one, certified BLE/Thread/Zigbee stacks, product line spans silicon vendors, team invests in Devicetree.

## Core Workflow
<!-- QUICK: 30s — scan phase titles -->
<!-- STANDARD: 3min — Do/Verify/Recover for every phase -->
<!-- DEEP: 10+min -->

### Phase 1 (~4 hours): Build System & Toolchain Setup
1. **Do:** Pin GCC ARM toolchain (e.g., `arm-none-eabi-gcc 12.3.rel1`). Never `latest` — a toolchain change invalidates all timing analysis. Docker image with SHA256 hash.
2. **Do:** `CMakeLists.txt` with toolchain file. Enable `-Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wdouble-promotion -Wshadow -Wundef`. Add `-fstack-usage` for `.su` stack analysis files.
3. **Do:** Linker script (`firmware.ld`): FLASH/RAM origin+length from datasheet. Partitions: bootloader + app A + app B + config + logs. Verify: `arm-none-eabi-nm --size-sort firmware.elf | tail -20`.
4. **Verify:** Two builds from same source produce identical `.bin` and `.elf`. Any difference = timestamp/random seed/uninitialized data embedded.
5. **Recover:** Non-reproducible → check for `__DATE__`, `__TIME__`, `__FILE__` macros. Replace with git SHA + build ID. Check linker map ordering.

### Phase 2 (~8 hours): BSP & Device Driver Development
1. **Do:** BSP: `bsp/board_name/` with `board.h` (pins, peripherals, clock), `board.c` (clock init, pinmux, power sequencing), `board_config.h` (feature flags, calibration from EEPROM).
2. **Do:** Driver pattern: `init()` → `configure()` → `start()` → `stop()` → `deinit()`. Every driver supports graceful shutdown. Every driver accepts `const void *config` — no hardcoded pins.
3. **Do:** DMA: double-buffering (ping-pong) for continuous streams. `__attribute__((aligned(32)))` + non-cacheable memory. DMA completion ISR checks errors before processing data.
4. **Verify:** Each driver self-test: SPI loopback 10K packets at max clock, I2C stress with bus resets, UART 1M baud 0% dropped over 1M chars.
5. **Recover:** Intermittent failures → capture bus with logic analyzer. 80% of "driver bugs" are signal integrity: missing I2C pull-ups, no SPI MISO termination, UART baud mismatch from HSI oscillator.

### Phase 3 (~6 hours): Boot Flow Implementation
1. **Do:** Boot sequence: (1) ROM validates boot pin, jumps to flash → (2) First-stage inits critical clocks + external RAM → (3) Second-stage validates app image signature → (4) App inits RTOS, mounts FS, starts tasks.
2. **Do:** Secure boot: public key hash in OTP or secure element. SHA-256 of app image, Ed25519 signature verify. Fail → attempt previous image boot.
3. **Do:** Boot reason detection: read reset cause register (RCC_CSR STM32, RESETREAS nRF) at boot. Log: power-on, pin reset, watchdog, brown-out, software reset, CPU lockup. Single most valuable field-debugging data point.
4. **Verify:** Every boot reason path tested with programmable PSU + fault injection. Image validation rejects: unsigned, wrong key, corrupted header, truncated.
5. **Recover:** Bootloader validates all but fails → check: flash offset alignment, signature format (raw Ed25519 vs ASN.1 DER), endianness mismatch (x86 gen vs big-endian MCU).

### Phase 4 (~6 hours): OTA Update Infrastructure
1. **Do:** OTA pipeline: CI builds → signs with release key → uploads to CDN/S3 with version metadata → devices poll → download to inactive partition with range-request resume → verify signature → set boot flag → reboot.
2. **Do:** Delta updates: `bsdiff` or `hdiffpatch` for NB-IoT/LTE-M links. Delta <20% of full image or not worthwhile. Delta decoding must fit in available RAM.
3. **Do:** Rollback: `boot_attempt_count` in persistent register/EEPROM. Increment per boot, clear on successful app heartbeat. >N (default 3) → mark image bad → revert.
4. **Verify:** OTA tested: power loss at 25%/50%/75%/99% of download → resume, corrupt payload → detect+reject, wrong version → reject downgrade, 1000 simultaneous devices → CDN handles load.
5. **Recover:** OTA failure must not require cloud connectivity to revert. Bootloader makes the revert decision locally. Network outage ≠ bricked devices.

### Phase 5 (~4 hours): Manufacturing Test Firmware
1. **Do:** Separate "factory" firmware: enters test mode on GPIO hold at power-on or UART magic sequence. Never ships to end users.
2. **Do:** Test routines: (a) peripheral self-test (SPI loopback, I2C ping, ADC test point, GPIO loopback), (b) radio test (TX CW for power, RX sensitivity sweep), (c) flash test (write/read/verify), (d) unique ID burn (MAC, serial, public key hash).
3. **Do:** Serialization: use factory-programmed unique ID (STM32 UID, nRF DEVICEID) as identity root. MAC in OTP/external EEPROM — never hardcoded in firmware.
4. **Verify:** All tests <60 seconds per device. 1000 units/day production line can't wait. Output: machine-parseable (JSON over UART or USB mass storage).
5. **Recover:** Test fails → output "FAIL: ADC ch3, expected 1.65V±0.05, measured 2.11V" to UART. Red LED pattern is not enough.

### Phase 6 (~5 hours): Firmware CI/CD Pipeline
1. **Do:** Docker build: pinned GCC, CMake, Python, device tools (nrfjprog, STM32_Programmer_CLI, esptool). Build matrix for all HW revisions.
2. **Do:** CI stages: (1) Lint (clang-format, cppcheck, MISRA), (2) Build all targets, (3) Unit tests on host with mocked HAL, (4) HIL on real hardware, (5) Sign artifacts, (6) Upload with version tag.
3. **Do:** Versioning: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-buildID`. MAJOR: incompatible OTA format. MINOR: new features, backward-compat. PATCH: bug fixes. Never reuse a version.
4. **Verify:** PR → build + unit + HIL smoke. Merge → full HIL suite. Release → signing + upload. HIL runner down → pipeline fails noisily, never silently skips hardware tests.
5. **Recover:** HIL runner health checks. Maintain standby HIL rig. Hardware tests are the gate — never bypass.

## Best Practices
<!-- STANDARD: 3min — rules from firmware teams shipping >500K devices -->

1. **Linker map review is part of code review.** Post `arm-none-eabi-nm --size-sort` diff. A new `printf` pulling in `malloc` adds 20KB — invisible in source diff, obvious in map diff.
2. **Never block in an ISR.** Capture state (<5 lines), defer to task/DPC, return. `while(flag)` in an ISR adds unbounded jitter. Refactor immediately.
3. **Use `volatile` correctly, not defensively.** Required: MMIO registers, ISR-modified variables, DMA descriptors. Harmful on regular variables — prevents optimization, 3-5× overhead. Missing memory barrier is the real bug, not missing `volatile`.
4. **Every peripheral has a timeout.** UART receive, I2C transaction, SPI DMA, flash erase — all have timeouts. Watchdog reset > infinite loop on dead hardware from a loose connector.
5. **Version your flash layout.** Magic number + layout version at known offset (e.g., `0x0800F000`). Bootloader checks compatibility. Without this, partition layout change → silent data corruption.
6. **Compression is cheaper than you think.** `heatshrink` (50-200 bytes decompressor, LZSS) compresses logs 4-8×. On BLE where 1KB flash = $0.02, compression pays for itself in 100 log lines. `miniz` (inflate, 12KB) for OTA delta decode.
7. **Assertions in release builds are worth the flash.** A 200-byte `assert()` that logs file + line + reset reason before reboot saves weeks of field debugging. Without it, you have zero clues.
8. **RAM functions for flash operations.** Code that erases/programs flash runs from RAM (`__attribute__((section(".ramfunc")))`). Silicon errata exists for nearly every MCU around this — read the errata.
9. **Initialize all stack memory.** FreeRTOS `configCHECK_FOR_STACK_OVERFLOW` paints stack with 0xA5. Catches overflow early instead of silent corruption for weeks.
10. **First 100ms after power-on are most dangerous.** Rails stabilizing, oscillators locking, BOD not armed. External supervisor IC (TPS3839) holds MCU in reset until rails stable. Firmware delays peripheral init 10ms after clock lock.

## Anti-Patterns

| ❌ Anti-Pattern | ✅ Do This Instead |
|---|---|
| Committing generated code (pin mux, clock config) to version control without review | Generated code goes through same PR review as hand-written code; reviewers verify against datasheet — a wrong clock divisor can brick remote devices |
| Using `volatile` defensively on every shared variable instead of proper synchronization | Use `volatile` only for MMIO registers, ISR-modified variables, and DMA descriptors; use memory barriers and atomic operations for multi-core/ISR thread safety |
| Removing assertions from release builds to "save flash" | Keep assertions in release: a 200-byte assert handler that logs file+line+reset reason before reboot is worth 10× its flash cost in field debugging time |
| Linking against newlib without understanding the heap pull-in | Audit linker map diff after every dependency change — `printf("%f")` pulls 15KB into flash; use `iprintf` or `mpaland/printf` (1.4KB) for embedded |
| Shipping firmware without versioned flash layout | Magic number + layout version at known offset (0x0800F000); bootloader checks compatibility and refuses to boot mismatched layout |
| Trusting the compiler to optimize away unused code without verifying | Post `arm-none-eabi-nm --size-sort` diff in every CI run; a stray `__weak` override or template instantiation can silently add 10KB |
| Building firmware without reproducible build verification | CI must produce bit-identical `.bin` from same commit; non-reproducible = cannot ship; check for timestamps, random seeds, build path embedding |
| Deploying OTA updates to entire fleet simultaneously | Staged rollout: 1% → 5% → 25% → 100% with auto-halt on elevated crash rate or boot failure; fleet-wide brick requires physical recall | 

## Error Decoder
<!-- QUICK: 30s -- exact error → root cause → fix -->
<!-- DEEP: 10+min -- war stories from production hardware failures -->

| Symptom | Root Cause | Fix | Lesson |
|---------|-----------|-----|--------|
| `arm-none-eabi-gcc: unrecognized '-mcpu=cortex-m33'` | GCC too old — M33 support added in GCC 8 | Pin GCC 12.3.rel1+. Someone updated base image. | Pin GCC version in toolchain file. Someone updating base image breaks builds. |
| `section '.bss' will not fit in region 'RAM'` | RAM overflow — .data + .bss + heap + stacks > physical | `arm-none-eabi-nm --size-sort \| tail -20`. Move large buffers to `.noinit`, reduce heap, replace `printf` (20KB) with minimal formatter. | nm --size-sort to find large buffers. Replace printf to save 20KB. |
| Device resets immediately after OTA | New firmware `.data` LMA overlaps bootloader flash region | Check linker script: bootloader region excluded from app flash origin. Compare `objdump -h` old vs new. | Check linker script — bootloader region must be excluded from app flash origin. |
| `HardFault_Handler` during `memcpy` to DMA buffer | Buffer not in non-cacheable memory — CPU cache and DMA disagree | Add buffer to `.nocache` linker section. `SCB_CleanInvalidateDCache()` before DMA, `SCB_InvalidateDCache()` after. | DMA buffers must be in non-cacheable memory. Flush cache before/after DMA. |
| Image 50% larger than previous build | Dependency pulled in `malloc`, `printf`, or exception handling | `grep 'malloc\|_sbrk\|__aeabi_' build/firmware.map`. Remove dependency or link `-nostdlib` with minimal stubs. | malloc, printf, and exception handling add significant size. Link -nostdlib if possible. |
| OTA signature verification fails, download succeeded | Endianness mismatch — x86 (LE) sig vs big-endian MCU | Use `mbedtls_mpi_read_binary()` (big-endian), not `_le` variant. Verify byte order explicitly in both signer and verifier. | Endianness mismatch between signing machine (x86 LE) and MCU (big-endian). |
| Debug (`-Og`) works; release (`-Os`) crashes on boot | Missing `volatile` or memory barrier — compiler reordered/eliminated "redundant" MMIO read | Add `volatile` to register struct. Add `__DSB()` after critical writes. Diff assembly between `-Og` and `-Os` at crash site. | Compiler optimizations reorder or eliminate MMIO reads. Use volatile and memory barriers. |
| Build not reproducible: SHA256 differs between runs | `__DATE__`/`__TIME__` macros, random seed, non-deterministic linker ordering | Replace with git SHA + build ID. Set linker `SORT_NONE`? Check `.cmake` toolchain for non-deterministic flags. | Remove __DATE__/__TIME__. Use deterministic linker ordering. |
| Firmware OTA update bricked entire fleet | Staged rollout wasn't used — 100% of devices received update simultaneously; bootloader had no rollback mechanism | Implement staged rollout: 1%, 5%, 20%, 50%, 100% with boot-success monitoring at each stage. Dual-bank flash with fallback image. | A smart lock startup bricked 40K devices in one push. The fix required physical reflash at dealer locations. Cost: $2.3M. |
| GPIO pin conflict from shared driver assumption | Two peripheral drivers both claimed same GPIO for chip select — second driver silently reconfigured it | Implement a GPIO registry: every pin assigned to exactly one driver at init time. Assert on double-claim. Document pin mux. | A custom PCB had the SD card CS and the display CS on the same GPIO. The display driver would fail randomly after the SD card was used. |
| Race condition on interrupt handler causing random crashes | Shared global variable written from ISR and main loop without volatile or critical section | All ISR-main shared data must be volatile, accessed atomically or within critical section. Use message queue pattern, not shared globals. | A motor controller occasionally jumped to full speed. Root cause: ISR set a new target speed that the main loop read non-atomically — half old, half new value. |
| Flash wear from excessive writes — device failed after 3 months | Logging system wrote to same flash sector every 5 minutes; sector endurance (10K cycles) exhausted in 90 days | Implement wear leveling. Move frequent writes to SPI NOR (100K cycles) or FRAM (10^13 cycles). Use internal flash for infrequent updates only. | An environmental sensor stopped recording after 87 days. Root cause: the data log sector had 25K+ erase cycles. Wear leveling would have extended life to 10+ years. |
| Production test fails 30%, all pass on re-test | Test firmware not executing full power-on self-test before measurement; residual state from previous test | Always execute a known device reset + POST before each production test. Include a reference measurement (precision resistor) at start of test sequence. | A contract manufacturer tested 10K units; 3K failed initially but passed retest. The $250K in rework was unnecessary — the test sequence didn't reset the ADC between units. |

## Cross-Skill Coordination
<!-- QUICK: 30s — who to talk to, when, what to share -->

### Coordinate With

| Coordinate With | When | What to Share/Ask |
|-----------------|------|-------------------|
| **Embedded Engineer** | BSP bring-up, driver design, bootloader architecture | Pin mux, clock tree for target power states, ISR priorities, DMA channel allocation |
| **Hardware Architect** | Memory map changes, new peripherals, boot pin strapping | Flash/RAM sizing, external memory interface timing, secure element I2C address and speed |

| **Security Engineer** | Secure boot, OTA signing, key management | Signature algorithm, key storage (secure element vs OTP), firmware encryption, vulnerability disclosure |

### Communication Triggers

| Trigger | Notify | Why |
|---------|--------|-----|
| New chip revision needs toolchain upgrade | Embedded Engineer, DevOps Engineer | Regression test entire fleet; breaks all Docker images |
| OTA download failure >5% fleet-wide | DevOps Engineer, Security Engineer | CDN health check; TLS cert expiry; storage outage |
| Bootloader bug found in production | Security Engineer, Embedded Engineer | Emergency OTA or physical recall; vulnerability severity |
| Build reproducibility broken | DevOps Engineer, QA Engineer | Audit toolchain pins; check for timestamps, random seeds |
| Factory test failure rate >2% spike | QA Engineer, Hardware Architect | PCB assembly vs firmware regression; halt production line |

### Escalation Path

```
Fleet bricking >0.1%? → Halt OTA → VP Engineering → Physical recall assessment
Build unreproducible >24h? → DevOps Engineer → Cannot ship → Escalate to CTO
Secure boot bypass found? → Security Engineer → Emergency OTA / HW respin + physical recall
Factory firmware blocking production? → QA Engineer → Production Manager → Revenue: $X/day
```

### Cross-Skill Chain

```bash
# Embedded bring-up → Firmware → QA → DevOps
/embedded-engineer && /firmware-developer && /qa-engineer && /devops-engineer
```

**Decision Gates & Handoff Artifacts:**
- **Build reproducibility gate:** Same commit must produce bit-identical `.bin` on CI and developer machine. `sha256sum firmware.bin` must match. Non-reproducible = cannot ship. Artifact: Build reproducibility verification log.
- **Driver stress test gate:** Every driver passes 10K-iteration stress: SPI at max clock, I2C with bus resets, UART at 1M baud with 1M chars, DMA with buffer wrap — zero timeouts. Artifact: Driver stress test report with per-driver results.
- **Memory map review gate:** Linker script must be reviewed by `hardware-architect` before production build. Flash/RAM section collisions = bricked device. Artifact: Memory map document with section sizes and alignment.
- **OTA integrity gate:** Signed image validation must pass: (1) signature verification, (2) version check (no downgrade attacks), (3) hardware compatibility check. Artifact: OTA security test report.
- **Factory firmware gate:** Factory test completes <60s, outputs pass/fail with measured values, operator interprets without engineering knowledge. Artifact: Factory test specification with pass/fail thresholds per test.
- **CI/CD quality gate:** CI must catch: missing `volatile`, uninitialized variables, stack overflow patterns, and signed/unsigned mismatches BEFORE merge. Artifact: CI pipeline configuration with mandatory checks.
- **Fleet health gate:** Boot success rate per firmware version; >1% degradation auto-halts OTA rollout. Artifact: Fleet health dashboard with per-version metrics.
- **Handoff to `embedded-engineer`:** BSP implementation, HAL API, peripheral drivers, bootloader integration. Artifact: Firmware binary with version manifest and release notes.
- **Handoff to `qa-engineer`:** Factory test firmware, HIL test scenarios, OTA test plans, regression test list. Artifact: QA test package with test firmware and test specifications.
- **Handoff to `security-reviewer`:** Secure boot implementation, OTA signing pipeline, key management architecture. Artifact: Security architecture document with threat model.

## Proactive Triggers

| Trigger | Action | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Build reproducibility check fails — same commit produces different binary | Audit toolchain pins: check for embedded timestamps (`__DATE__`, `__TIME__`), random seeds, build path in debug symbols; fix within 24 hours | Non-reproducible builds cannot be audited — if you can't verify the binary matches the source, you can't ship |
| OTA download failure rate exceeds 5% fleet-wide | Investigate CDN health, TLS certificate expiry, storage availability; halt rollout if download failures correlate with specific region or device model | High download failure rate may indicate CDN outage or expired certificate — not a firmware bug but equally disruptive |
| CI pipeline skips HIL tests because runner is down | Halt pipeline — never silently skip hardware tests; HIL runner down = pipeline fails noisily; maintain standby HIL rig | Silent HIL skip is a process failure that masks real bugs; the most dangerous CI failure mode is the one you don't notice |
| New dependency (library, RTOS version) adds >5KB to flash footprint | Audit linker map diff before merge; identify what pulled in the new code; reject if not justified by feature value | Flash bloat is death by a thousand cuts — each dependency adds a little, and one day you're out of flash |
| Factory test firmware doesn't match production firmware version | Halt production; factory test must run same version as shipping; version mismatch = untested code paths in production | Testing one version and shipping another defeats the purpose of factory testing |
| Stack overflow pattern detected in field crash dumps (0xA5 paint corrupted) | Increase affected task stack by 50% immediately; run 24-hour stress test with stack monitoring; audit all task stacks quarterly | Stack overflow in the field is nearly impossible to debug post-hoc — proactive monitoring is the only defense |
| Security researcher reports bootloader vulnerability with proof of concept | Acknowledge within 4 hours; assess severity and exploitability; if remotely exploitable, prepare emergency OTA within 48 hours; publish advisory | Delayed response to security reports erodes trust and may trigger regulatory obligations |
| Fleet boot success rate drops below 99.9% for any firmware version | Auto-halt OTA rollout for affected version; investigate within 2 hours; compare boot failure patterns across hardware revisions and geographies | Boot success rate is the single best fleet health metric — degradation precedes major incidents |

## Scale Depth: Solo → Small → Medium → Enterprise

### Solo
Single developer, dev kits and breadboards, hobbyist EDA (KiCad/EAGLE). Focus: proof of concept, basic functionality. Skip: full compliance testing, DFM optimization. Coordination: with hardware architect on component selection for manufacturability.

### Small Team
Small engineering team, custom PCB, professional EDA (Altium/OrCAD). Focus: first production run, basic EMC pre-compliance. Coordination: with firmware on HAL API contracts, with test on production fixture design.

### Medium Team
Cross-functional hardware team (HW, FW, ME, test), contract manufacturing. Focus: DFM, full compliance certification (FCC/CE/UL). Coordination: with supply chain on BOM cost optimization, with ops on NPI, with QA on reliability testing.

### Enterprise
Multi-product platform architecture, global regulatory compliance, automated test infrastructure. Focus: supply chain resilience, silicon validation. Coordination: with manufacturing partners globally, with regulatory affairs on country-specific certifications, with security on hardware root of trust.

### Transition Triggers
| From → To | Trigger |
|-----------|---------|
| Solo → Small | First 100-unit production run; customer requires CE/FCC marking |
| Small → Medium | Product expansion to multiple SKUs; >10 engineering headcount |
| Medium → Enterprise | Operating in 5+ regulated jurisdictions; automotive/medical safety-critical certification |

## What Good Looks Like
<!-- DEEP: 10+min — concrete success criteria -->

- Build system produces bit-identical `.bin` from same commit; `sha256sum firmware.bin` matches CI ↔ developer machine.
- Every driver passes 10K-iteration stress: SPI at max clock, I2C with bus resets, UART at 1M baud with 1M chars, DMA with buffer wrap — zero timeouts.
- Bootloader validates signatures, rejects unsigned/corrupt images, boots previous after 3 failures, logs boot reason — all on real hardware.
- OTA survives power loss at every 10% of download; after 100 random power-loss tests, device always boots a valid image (old or new, never corrupted).
- Factory firmware completes all tests <60s, outputs pass/fail with measured values; operator interprets without engineering knowledge.
- CI pipeline catches missing `volatile` qualifier (via `-O2` failing where `-Og` passes) BEFORE merge.
- Fleet dashboard: boot success rate per firmware version; >1% degradation auto-halts OTA rollout.
