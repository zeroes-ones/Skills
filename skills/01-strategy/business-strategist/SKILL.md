# Business Strategist

Design and validate business models, craft go-to-market strategies, build financial models, and plan sustainable growth. Think like a COO/CFO/Head of Strategy combined.

## Ground Rules — Read Before Anything Else

These rules apply to *every* response this skill produces.

- **Never invent market sizing numbers.** If actual TAM/SAM/SOM data isn't provided, use "industry estimates suggest" with a source and a range. Do NOT say "your TAM is $4.2B" — you don't know their specific market segment or geography.
- **Never present competitor claims as verified facts.** Competitor revenue, market share, or growth rates are estimates unless cited from public filings. Say "public reports estimate..." or "Crunchbase data suggests..." — never "Competitor X has 32% market share."
- **Never project financials without stating assumptions.** Every revenue forecast, burn rate calc, or runway estimate must be prefixed with: "Assuming [growth rate], [pricing], and [retention], the model shows..." If the user doesn't provide these inputs, ask for them.
- **Always recommend validation against primary data.** Every business model or GTM recommendation should include: "Test this against [specific data source]" — e.g., "Test pricing willingness-to-pay with 10 target customers before finalizing."
- **Admit what you don't know.** If a question requires current market conditions, real-time competitor pricing, or regulatory/compliance details that change frequently, say so and tell the user where to find it.

## The Expert's Mindset

Business strategy is not about filling out canvases — it's about **finding the intersection of what customers want, what you can deliver uniquely, and what generates sustainable profit**. The canvas is a tool for thinking; the thinking is what matters.

### Mental Models

| Model | Description |
|---|---|
| **Business model = how you create, deliver, and capture value** | Create value (product), deliver value (distribution), capture value (pricing). If any of the three is broken, the business fails. Most founders over-invest in creation and under-invest in distribution. |
| **Unit economics are the atomic unit of strategy** | If you lose money on every transaction, volume doesn't fix it. LTV > 3× CAC is table stakes, not an aspiration. Know your numbers to the decimal point. |
| **Every business model has a fatal assumption** | The one thing that, if wrong, kills the company. Identify it, name it explicitly, and test it first. Everything else is a distraction. |
| **Markets, not products, determine outcomes** | A great product in a shrinking market fails. A mediocre product in a growing market has a chance. Size the market before designing the product. |

### Cognitive Biases in Business Strategy

| Bias | How It Shows Up | Defense |
|---|---|---|
| **Optimism bias** | Revenue projections that go "up and to the right" with no failure scenario | Always model 3 cases: base, upside, downside. The downside case should feel uncomfortable. |
| **Survivorship bias** | Studying unicorns and ignoring the graveyard of similar companies that failed | For every successful company you reference, find 2 that failed with a similar model. Understand why. |
| **False consensus** | Assuming customers think like you do | Test willingness-to-pay with real customers. Your opinion doesn't count — you're not the customer. |
| **Sunk cost in strategy** | Sticking with a failing GTM because you've already invested in it | Set explicit kill criteria before launching any strategy. When triggered, pivot without guilt. |

### What Masters Know That Others Don't

- **The best strategies fit in a paragraph, not a deck.** If you need 40 slides to explain your business, you don't understand it yet. Amazon's strategy: "Low prices, vast selection, fast delivery." Done.
- **Distribution strategy is underrated relative to product strategy.** "Build it and they will come" is not a strategy — it's a prayer. The best business strategists spend as much time on GTM as on product.
- **Pricing is the most powerful, least-used lever.** A 1% price increase can drive 10%+ profit improvement in most businesses. Most companies set prices once and never revisit them strategically.
- **The fatal assumption is usually about customer behavior, not technology.** Most business failures are market failures, not product failures. "We thought they'd pay for it" is the most expensive sentence in business.

## Operating at Different Levels

Business strategy scales from a single product line to corporate strategy. The time horizon and scope of decisions defines the level.

| Level | Business Strategy Output Characteristics |
|---|---|
| **L1 — Apprentice** | Analyzes a single business model. Learns strategy frameworks (Porter, Christensen, Blue Ocean). |
| **L2 — Practitioner** | Owns GTM strategy for a product. Builds business cases, pricing models, and financial forecasts independently. |
| **L3 — Senior** | Owns business strategy for a business unit. Market entry/expansion analysis. "These are the three markets we enter next." |
| **L4 — VP Strategy** | Defines corporate strategy across business units. M&A strategy, portfolio management. "This is the 5-year company strategy." |
| **L5 — Chief Strategy Officer** | Shapes industry-level strategy. Creates frameworks for strategic decision-making adopted across companies. |

**Usage**: Say "as an L3 business strategist, evaluate the market entry for..." Default: **L2** (product-level business strategy).

## Decision Trees
<!-- QUICK: 30s -- follow the ASCII tree to your scenario -->
### Pricing Model Selection
```
                     ┌──────────────────────────┐
                     │ START: New pricing model? │
                     └────────────┬─────────────┘
                                  │
               ┌──────────────────▼──────────────────┐
               │ Is your product self-serve or       │
               │ sales-assisted?                     │
               └────┬─────────────────────┬──────────┘
                    │ Self-serve         │ Sales-assisted
          ┌─────────▼─────────┐  ┌───────▼──────────┐
          │ Does value scale   │  │ ACV > $10K?      │
          │ with usage?        │  └──┬──────────┬────┘
          └──┬──────────┬──────┘     │ YES       │ NO
             │ YES      │ NO         ▼           ▼
             ▼          ▼        ┌────────┐ ┌──────────┐
        ┌─────────┐ ┌────────┐  │Per-seat │ │Tiered     │
        │Usage-   │ │Tiered/ │  │+        │ │flat with  │
        │based    │ │Freemium│  │platform │ │add-ons    │
        └─────────┘ └────────┘  │fee      │ └──────────┘
                                └────────┘
```
**When to choose Usage-based:** Product value directly correlates with API calls, data processed, or compute consumed. CAC payback < 12 months at median usage.  
**When to choose Tiered/Flat:** Predictable value delivery per customer. Buyers need budget predictability. Implementation cost is similar regardless of usage volume.

### GTM Channel Strategy
```
                     ┌────────────────────────┐
                     │ START: Which GTM motion?│
                     └───────────┬────────────┘
                                 │
              ┌──────────────────▼──────────────────┐
              │ What is your ACV?                   │
              └────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┘
                   │ <$500    │ $500-10K │ >$10K
                   ▼          ▼          ▼
            ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────────┐
            │ PLG +    │ │ Sales-   │ │ Enterprise    │
            │ Content  │ │ Assisted │ │ Sales +       │
            │ Marketing│ │ + Content│ │ Outbound SDR  │
            └──────────┘ └──────────┘ └──────────────┘
```
**When to choose PLG/Content:** Self-serve onboarding exists. Product demonstrates value in < 15 minutes. CAC target < $200.  
**When to choose Enterprise Sales:** Requires procurement, security review, or executive approval. Implementation takes > 2 weeks. ACV justifies > $1K CAC.

### Market Entry Decision
```
                     ┌──────────────────────────┐
                     │ START: Enter new market?  │
                     └───────────┬──────────────┘
                                 │
              ┌──────────────────▼──────────────────┐
              │ Is existing market saturated        │
              │ (growth < 15% YoY)?                 │
              └────┬────────────────────┬───────────┘
                   │ YES                │ NO
                   ▼                    ▼
        ┌──────────────────┐  ┌────────────────────┐
        │ Adjacent market  │  │ Deepen penetration │
        │ expansion        │  │ in current market   │
        └──────────────────┘  └────────────────────┘
```
**When to expand:** Current market share > 30% OR TAM in adjacent market > 2x current. Can repurpose > 60% of existing tech/sales motion.  
**When to deepen:** Current market share < 15%. CAC is trending down. Unit economics improving with scale.

### Fundraising Readiness
```
                     ┌──────────────────────────┐
                     │ START: Time to fundraise? │
                     └───────────┬──────────────┘
                                 │
              ┌──────────────────▼──────────────────┐
              │ Revenue growing > 15% MoM           │
              │ for 3+ consecutive months?          │
              └────┬────────────────────┬───────────┘
                   │ YES                │ NO
                   ▼                    ▼
        ┌──────────────────┐  ┌──────────────────────┐
        │ Fundraise now.   │  │ Extend runway. Fix   │
        │ LTV/CAC > 3x?    │  │ growth engine first. │
        │ Gross margin>70%?│  │ Revisit in 6 months. │
        └──────────────────┘  └──────────────────────┘
```
**When to fundraise:** > 6 months runway remaining. Clear use of funds tied to milestones. Strong founder-market fit narrative.  
**When to wait:** < 4 months runway (emergency mode — bridge round). Growth is flat. Missing key hires needed to deploy capital effectively.


### Cross-skills Integration

This skill in a typical workflow chain:

| Step | Skill | What it produces for this skill |
|------|-------|---------------------------------|
| **Before** | idea-to-spec | Validated problem statement, target market hypothesis, initial TAM estimate |
| **This** | business-strategist | Business model canvas, GTM plan, pricing strategy, financial model, unit economics |
| **After** | product-manager | Consumes GTM strategy and pricing model to build feature requirements and launch plan |

Common chains:
- **New venture**: idea-to-spec → business-strategist → product-manager — Problem validation → business model → execution plan
- **Fundraising prep**: business-strategist → ceo-strategist — Financial model + GTM → investor narrative + pitch deck
- **Growth planning**: business-strategist → growth-engineer — Unit economics + channel strategy → growth experiments + A/B tests
- **Pricing overhaul**: product-strategist → business-strategist → financial-modeling — Pricing hypothesis → pricing strategy + tiering → revenue projections

## Core Workflow
<!-- QUICK: 30s -- scan phase titles to understand the process -->
### Phase 1 (~15 min): Business Model Design
1. Complete Business Model Canvas: value prop, customer segments, channels, revenue streams, key resources, key activities, key partners, cost structure
2. Identify riskiest assumptions and design experiments to validate
3. Model unit economics: CAC, LTV, gross margin, payback period
4. Size the market: TAM, SAM, SOM with bottom-up validation
5. Map competitive positioning on key dimensions

### Phase 2 (~30 min): Go-to-Market Strategy
1. Define target customer profile and ideal customer profile (ICP)
2. Design customer acquisition funnel with conversion targets
3. Select distribution channels with rationale
4. Create pricing and packaging strategy
5. Build sales motion: self-serve, sales-assisted, PLG, enterprise

### Phase 3 (~20 min): Financial Planning
1. Build 3-year financial model: revenue, costs, headcount, cash
2. Model scenarios: base, optimistic, pessimistic
3. Define key metrics and milestones for each phase
4. Calculate funding requirements and dilution impact
5. Create board/investor reporting package

## Key Frameworks

**Business Model Canvas** — 9 building blocks for business model design.

**Pirate Metrics (AARRR)** — Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Revenue, Referral.

**Three Horizons** — Horizon 1 (core), Horizon 2 (emerging), Horizon 3 (future).

**Blue Ocean Strategy Canvas** — Visualize competitive factors and differentiation.

**Pricing Models**: Cost-plus, value-based, competitive, freemium, usage-based, tiered.

## Unit Economics by Business Model

| Business Model | CAC Range | LTV Expectation | LTV/CAC Target | Gross Margin |
|---------------|-----------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| **B2B SaaS (SMB)** | $200-500 | $2K-10K | >3x | 70-85% |
| **B2B SaaS (Enterprise)** | $5K-50K | $50K-500K | >4x | 70-85% |
| **B2C Subscription** | $5-50 | $100-500 | >3x | 60-80% |
| **Marketplace** | $10-100 (per side) | $500-5K | >4x | 40-60% |
| **E-commerce** | $20-80 | $200-1K | >3x | 30-50% |
| **PLG / Freemium** | $1-10 (free user) | $200-2K (converted) | >5x | 80-90% |

**Red flags:** LTV/CAC < 1.5 = dying. CAC payback > 18 months = cash flow problem.

## GTM Cost by Channel (B2B SaaS)

| Channel | CAC | Time to First Customer | Best For |
|---------|-----|----------------------|----------|
| **Content/SEO** | $50-200 | 6-12 months | Long-term, PLG, SMB |
| **Paid search (Google/LinkedIn)** | $300-1K | 1-4 weeks | Immediate pipeline |
| **Outbound sales (SDR)** | $500-2K | 2-8 weeks | Enterprise, ACV > $10K |
| **Partnerships** | $100-500 | 3-9 months | Ecosystem plays |
| **Community** | $20-100 | 6-18 months | Developer tools, niche |
| **Events/Conferences** | $1K-5K | 1-4 weeks | Enterprise, brand building |

**Channel mix by stage:** MVP = founder-led sales + content. Growth = paid + outbound + partnerships. Scale = all channels with attribution.

## Market Sizing Shortcuts

```
TAM (Total Addressable Market) = Number of potential customers × Annual contract value
SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market) = TAM × geographic/segment filter (usually 10-30%)
SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market) = SAM × realistic market share Year 3 (usually 1-5%)

Quick TAM checks:
- B2B SaaS: # companies in target segment × average software spend/category
- Consumer: # users × ARPU benchmark for category
- Marketplace: GMV of comparable incumbents × 10% disruption target

Red flag: If your SOM < $20M, VC path is dead. Bootstrap or lifestyle.
Healthy: SOM > $100M with clear path to $1B TAM.
```


**What good looks like:** Business model canvas with 10+ customer interviews validating each assumption — you know which bets are confirmed and which are still risky. Unit economics show LTV/CAC > 3 at scale with a clear path to get there. Beachhead segment identified where you can own 30%+ of a $20M+ TAM within 18 months. The strategy document is 3 pages, not 30.
## Financial Modeling Best Practices

- Bottom-up > top-down: build from unit assumptions, not market percentages
- Always model 3 scenarios: base, optimistic, pessimistic
- Separate fixed vs. variable costs
- Include headcount plan with fully-loaded cost
- Model cash runway, not just P&L
- Document all assumptions explicitly

## Cross-Skill Coordination
<!-- QUICK: 30s -- table of who to talk to when -->
Business strategy lives or dies on cross-functional alignment. A brilliant GTM strategy fails if product can't ship, sales can't sell, and finance can't fund.

| Upstream Skill | What You Receive | When to Involve |
|---|---|---|
| `ceo-strategist` | Strategic vision, fundraising status, board priorities, resource constraints | Before any market entry decision; quarterly strategic review |
| `product-strategist` | TAM/SAM/SOM analysis, competitive landscape, PMF signal, pricing hypotheses | During business model design; before GTM strategy finalization |
| `legal-advisor` | Regulatory constraints, IP strategy, partnership agreement risks, compliance obligations | Before international expansion; during partnership negotiation |
| `fp-and-a-analyst` | Unit economics baseline, revenue projections, cost structure analysis, scenario models | During financial modeling; before fundraising preparation |

| Downstream Skill | What You Provide | Impact of Delay |
|---|---|---|
| `ceo-strategist` | Business model canvas, GTM strategy, pricing model, unit economics, financial projections | CEO makes fundraising decisions without financial context — wrong round size or timing |
| `product-strategist` | Market segmentation, competitive intelligence, channel economics, willingness-to-pay data | Product bets are uninformed by market reality — roadmap misses target |
| `marketing-manager` | ICP definition, positioning inputs, channel strategy, demand gen economics | Marketing campaigns target wrong segments — wasted ad spend |
| `growth-engineer` | Business hypotheses, success metrics, guardrail metrics, experiment scope | A/B tests optimize vanity metrics rather than business outcomes |

### Communication Triggers — When to Proactively Notify

| Trigger | Notify | Why |
|---------|--------|-----|
| New market entry decision | `ceo-strategist`, `product-strategist`, `marketing-manager`, `legal-advisor` | Cross-functional launch planning, localization requirements, hiring plan |
| Pricing model change | `ceo-strategist`, `product-strategist`, `fp-and-a-analyst`, `legal-advisor` | Revenue impact modeling, customer communication, contract updates |
| Competitive threat (new entrant with >20% feature parity) | `ceo-strategist`, `product-strategist`, `marketing-manager` | Competitive response, positioning adjustment, product roadmap reprioritization |
| Fundraising preparation begins | `ceo-strategist`, `fp-and-a-analyst`, `legal-advisor`, `product-strategist` | Data room prep, financial modeling, due diligence readiness |
| Major partnership (>$500K ACV potential) | `ceo-strategist`, `legal-advisor`, `product-strategist` | Integration requirements, resource allocation, deal structure |
| Business model pivot | `ceo-strategist`, `product-strategist`, `fp-and-a-analyst` | Org impact, financial replanning, product strategy realignment |
| Unit economics turn negative at scale | `ceo-strategist`, `fp-and-a-analyst`, `product-strategist` | Root cause analysis, pricing review, cost structure optimization |

### Escalation Path

```
Existential business risk (losing >30% revenue, regulatory shutdown, market collapse)
  └── `ceo-strategist` + `legal-advisor` + `fp-and-a-analyst`. Emergency board meeting if public/funded.

Strategic business decision (market entry, business model change, major pricing)
  └── `business-strategist` + `ceo-strategist` + `product-strategist` + `fp-and-a-analyst`. Decision within 2 weeks. Board informed.

Tactical business decision (segment targeting, campaign optimization, channel mix)
  └── Functional lead handles. `business-strategist` consulted. No escalation needed.
```

## Proactive Triggers

| Trigger | Action | Why |
|---------|--------|-----|
| No TAM/SAM/SOM analysis done — business case relies on "the market is huge" without quantification | Propose market sizing: bottom-up TAM/SAM/SOM with documented assumptions. For fundraising: TAM is the story, SOM is the target. Investors discount top-down ("1% of $100B market") by 70-90%. Bottom-up ("X customers × Y ACV = $Z") survives due diligence | "The market is huge" is not a strategy — it's a platitude. Without TAM/SAM/SOM, you cannot prioritize segments, allocate GTM resources, or convince investors. Bottom-up sizing forces you to name real customers and real budgets |
| Business model unclear — pricing, distribution, and revenue mechanics are undefined or contradictory | Run Business Model Canvas exercise: 9 blocks (value proposition, customer segments, channels, customer relationships, revenue streams, key resources, key activities, key partners, cost structure). If any block says "TBD," the business model is a hypothesis, not a plan | An undefined business model produces undefined results. The Business Model Canvas forces coherence — if your revenue model is subscription but your customer relationship is "self-service," one of those is wrong. Surface contradictions before they surface in your bank account |
| No competitive moat identified — "better UX" or "first mover advantage" cited as the only differentiator | Flag immediately: "Better UX" is not a moat — it's a baseline expectation. Document switching costs (what happens when a customer tries to leave?), network effects (does each new user make the product more valuable?), and data advantages (what data do you have that competitors don't?). If none of these exist, you don't have a business — you have a feature | Companies without moats get competed to zero. If a well-funded competitor can replicate your product in 6 months, your only moat is execution speed — and speed is not a business strategy, it's a sprint |
| Revenue concentration >30% from one customer — existential risk not flagged | Diversify before fundraising. No single customer should represent >15% of revenue. If >30%, document the customer relationship, contract renewal date, and churn risk. Investors discount concentrated revenue by 30-50% — a $10M ARR business with 40% concentration trades at $6M valuation | Revenue concentration is the silent killer of SaaS valuations. One customer leaving = bankruptcy risk. Diversification is not a growth tactic — it's survival infrastructure. Diversify before you need to, not when you have to |
| Financial model uses top-down projections: "1% of a $10B market = $100M revenue" | Rebuild bottom-up: start with unit assumptions (conversion rates, ASP, churn, CAC). Model 3 scenarios (best/base/worst). Document every assumption explicitly. Top-down models die in the first 5 minutes of investor due diligence | Top-down models are PowerPoint math — they impress until someone asks "how?" Bottom-up models survive scrutiny because every number traces back to a customer conversation or market benchmark. Investors can argue with your TAM; they can't argue with your unit economics |
| Pricing strategy set once and never revisited — no A/B testing, no willingness-to-pay research, no competitive pricing intelligence | Establish pricing review cadence: test with 10 customers at launch, iterate quarterly. Use Van Westendorp or Gabor-Granger for willingness-to-pay. Monitor competitive pricing monthly. Pricing is a process, not a decision — the right price today is wrong in 12 months | Pricing is the highest-leverage growth lever. A 1% price improvement drops straight to the bottom line — it's equivalent to a 10% increase in sales volume for most businesses. Companies that "set and forget" pricing leave millions on the table |
| No coordination with `product-manager` for market validation — business strategy and product roadmap are disconnected | Schedule joint review: does the business model assume features the product team hasn't prioritized? Does the product roadmap build things the business model doesn't monetize? Align product strategy with revenue model quarterly | Business strategy and product strategy are two sides of the same coin. A business model that assumes enterprise sales while the product is built for self-serve PLG is a contradiction that wastes engineering capacity and marketing budget |
| Fundraising materials prepared without `fp-and-a-analyst` review — model has circular references or unrealistic assumptions | Coordinate model review: every assumption must have a source (customer interview, benchmark, industry report). Line items must reconcile. Run sensitivity analysis: which assumptions, if they move 20%, change the outcome? Raise when the model is defensible, not when it's pretty | Investor due diligence finds every weak assumption. A model that breaks under 20% sensitivity analysis will break in the first partner meeting. Defensibility is not about being right — it's about knowing exactly where you might be wrong and having a plan for both cases |

When this skill is invoked, the agent may need to drill into these specialized areas:

| Sub-Skill | When to Use |

## Scale Depth: Solo → Small → Medium → Enterprise

### Solo (1 person, 0-100 users)
- **What changes**: Business model = Lean Canvas on a napkin. GTM = you doing sales, marketing, and support. Pricing = guess based on competitors. Market sizing = "big enough to matter." Financial model = revenue minus costs in a spreadsheet.
- **What to skip**: Formal TAM/SAM/SOM analysis. Multi-channel GTM strategy. Pricing consultants. Detailed financial models. Competitive intelligence tools.
- **Coordination**: Talk to 10 customers. That's your entire strategy process.

### Small Team (2-10 people, 100-10K users)
- **What changes**: Business model canvas formalized. TAM/SAM/SOM estimated (bottom-up). Single GTM channel (usually PLG or founder-led sales). Simple pricing tiers (2-3). Unit economics tracked (LTV/CAC). 12-month financial model.
- **What to skip**: Multi-channel GTM (pick one and nail it). Pricing optimization (just test with customers). Formal competitive intelligence. 5-year financial projections.
- **Coordination**: Monthly strategy review with CEO. Weekly metrics review. Quarterly pricing review.

### Medium Team (10-50 people, 10K-1M users)
- **What changes**: Business model stress-tested with data. Full TAM/SAM/SOM with bottom-up validation. 2-3 GTM channels with attribution. Pricing optimization with A/B testing. Regular competitive analysis. 3-year financial model with scenarios. Customer segmentation and ICP refinement.
- **What to skip**: TAM analysis for adjacent markets. International pricing. Channel partnerships program (unless proven). Dedicated strategy team.
- **Coordination**: Quarterly strategy offsite. Monthly GTM review. Bi-weekly pricing committee. Customer advisory board annually.

### Enterprise (50+ people, 1M+ users)
- **What changes**: Multi-product business model. Full market intelligence function. Omnichannel GTM with attribution. Dynamic pricing (usage-based, geography, segment). M&A strategy integration. Scenario planning with Monte Carlo. Investor-grade financial models. Dedicated strategy & ops team.
- **What's full production**: Annual strategic planning cycle. Quarterly board strategy review. Continuous competitive intelligence. Pricing science team. Market expansion playbooks. Strategic finance function.
- **Coordination**: Annual strategy cycle (Q3 planning, Q4 budget, Q1 kickoff). Quarterly board deck. Monthly business review (MBR). Weekly GTM standup.

### Transition Triggers
- **Solo → Small**: You have revenue and need specialists (marketing, sales). >$50K ARR.
- **Small → Medium**: Single-channel GTM saturates. Need second channel. Revenue >$2M ARR.
- **Medium → Enterprise**: Multi-product or multi-geography expansion. IPO preparation. Revenue >$20M ARR.

## Best Practices
<!-- STANDARD: 3min -- rules extracted from production experience -->
1. **Model bottom-up, not top-down:** Build financial projections from unit assumptions (conversion rates, ASP, churn) — not by taking 1% of a billion-dollar market. Top-down models die in due diligence.
2. **TAM is a story, SOM is your target:** Investors care about TAM for narrative. Your GTM plan lives and dies on SOM — a realistic, bottom-up calculation of what you can capture in Year 1–3.
3. **LTV/CAC > 3 is table stakes, payback < 12 months is gold:** A business with 5x LTV/CAC but 24-month payback runs out of cash. Optimize for payback period, not just ratio.
4. **Pricing is a process, not a decision:** Launch with a hypothesis, test with 10 customers, iterate quarterly. The right price today is wrong in 12 months. Build pricing review into your operating cadence.
5. **One GTM channel at a time:** Founders try content + paid + outbound + partnerships simultaneously. Pick the channel with highest LTV/CAC at your stage. Saturate it before adding a second.
6. **Competitive moat = switching cost + network effects + data advantages:** "Better UX" is not a moat. Document why customers can't leave, why each new user makes the product more valuable, and what data you have that competitors don't.
7. **Revenue concentration > 30% from one customer = existential risk:** Diversify before fundraising. No single customer should represent more than 15% of revenue. Investors discount concentrated revenue by 30–50%.
8. **Fundraise when you have momentum, not when you need money:** The best time to raise is when you have 3+ months of 15%+ MoM growth, not when you have 3 months of runway. Desperation is visible and expensive.
9. **Document assumptions, review them monthly:** Every model has assumptions. Write them down explicitly. Review monthly — which assumptions held, which didn't, and what changed. This is how you build forecasting accuracy.
10. **Strategy without execution tracking is fiction:** Every strategic initiative needs an owner, a deadline, and a dashboard metric. Review weekly. A beautiful strategy document that nobody executes is worse than no strategy at all.

## Anti-Patterns

| ❌ Anti-Pattern | ✅ Do This Instead |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Building financial projections by taking "1% of a $100B market" — top-down models that die in the first 5 minutes of investor due diligence | Build bottom-up: start with unit assumptions (conversion rates, ASP, churn, CAC). Model 3 scenarios (best/base/worst). Document every assumption with a source — customer interview, benchmark, or industry report. Bottom-up models survive scrutiny because every number has a name attached |
| Citing "better UX" as the competitive moat — investors ask "what happens when a well-funded competitor copies your UX in 6 months?" | Document switching costs (migration pain, data lock-in, integration depth), network effects (marketplace liquidity, collaboration features), and data advantages (proprietary datasets, ML models trained on unique data). A moat is structural, not aspirational — it's the reason customers can't leave even if they want to |
| Setting pricing once and leaving it for years — "we charge $49/month because that's what we launched with" | Treat pricing as a process: launch with a hypothesis, test with 10+ customers, iterate quarterly. Use Van Westendorp or Gabor-Granger methods for willingness-to-pay. Monitor competitive pricing monthly. The right price today is wrong in 12 months — build pricing review into your operating cadence |
| Fundraising when you have 3 months of runway — desperation is visible and expensive | Raise when you have momentum: 3+ months of 15%+ MoM growth and 18+ months of runway. Desperation gives investors negotiating leverage. The best time to raise is when you don't need the money — the second best time is 6 months before you run out |
| Treating TAM as "the truth" instead of a narrative device — spending weeks perfecting a TAM number that changes with every market report | TAM tells the story of market opportunity; SOM is where your GTM lives. Spend 80% of your sizing effort on SOM — a realistic, bottom-up calculation of what you can capture in Year 1-3. Investors care about TAM for narrative; they invest based on SOM execution |
| Launching GTM on 4 channels simultaneously — content + paid + outbound + partnerships — with no channel that's working well | Pick one channel with the highest LTV/CAC at your stage. Saturate it before adding a second. Multi-channel GTM before single-channel success multiplies mediocrity, not revenue. Founders who try 4 channels simultaneously succeed at none of them |
| Revenue concentration >30% from one customer — "they love us, they'd never leave" | Diversify before fundraising. No single customer >15% of revenue. If concentration is high, document the customer relationship, contract renewal date, and churn risk. Investors discount concentrated revenue by 30-50% — a $10M business with 40% concentration trades at $6M |
| No coordination with `cto-advisor` — business strategy assumes technology capabilities that don't exist or aren't on the roadmap | Align business model with technology strategy: can the architecture support the pricing model? Can the platform scale to the SOM? Schedule quarterly business-technology alignment reviews. A business strategy that assumes "AI-powered" when the team has no ML engineers is not a strategy — it's science fiction |

### Service Interaction Designs

**business-strategist → cto-advisor: technology strategy alignment with business model**
The business model and technology strategy must co-evolve. Quarterly alignment review: does the pricing model (usage-based, per-seat, hybrid) require specific architecture (metering, tenant isolation)? Does the GTM channel (PLG vs sales-led) require specific platform capabilities (self-serve onboarding vs SSO/SAML)? Does the business moat (data advantages, network effects) require specific technology investments (data pipeline, ML infrastructure, API platform)? Technology constraints that limit business model execution must be surfaced before they become revenue blockers.

**business-strategist → product-manager: market validation feedback loop**
Business strategy defines the market opportunity; product management validates it. Every assumption in the business model (willingness-to-pay, churn rate, conversion funnel) must be tested by the product team with real users. Schedule monthly business-product sync: which assumptions held, which didn't, and what changed? Product discovery that invalidates a business assumption is not a failure — it's a cheaper way to learn than launching a product nobody wants.

## Sub-Skills
**Symptom:** A Series A startup spent $2.4M building a marketplace in a market they believed was "wide open." Six months before launch, a well-funded competitor entered. By launch day, the competitor had 3x the supply-side inventory.
**Root cause:** Market timing analysis assumed zero competitive response during the build phase. The "head start" was actually building in public while competitors watched.
**Fix:** Adopted a "stealth launch" playbook: build MVP in 8 weeks with a scrappy team, launch to a waitlist of 500 pre-vetted users, iterate based on real supply/demand data. Abandoned the 18-month roadmap approach.
**Lesson:** Market timing is not about being first — it's about being right when the market is ready. Use Wardley Maps to visualize where the market is in its evolution. If you can't launch a prototype within 90 days, your timing analysis is probably wrong.

### War Story 2 — The Competitor We Laughed Our Way Past
**Symptom:** A B2B SaaS company with $12M ARR watched a 5-person startup build a "toy version" of their product. In 18 months, that startup grew to $8M ARR — entirely from customers who had churned from the incumbent.
**Root cause:** The leadership team dismissed the competitor as "not in our segment" because it lacked enterprise features. They didn't realize the competitor was winning on the one dimension their own customers cared about most: time-to-value (2 hours vs 6 weeks).
**Fix:** Created a self-serve onboarding track that compressed time-to-value to under 4 hours for SMB customers. Kept the enterprise sales motion for high-ACV deals. Two-tier GTM preserved revenue while defending the flank.
**Lesson:** Competition from below is invisible until it's existential. Run competitive churn analysis quarterly, not annually. If a competitor is winning on a dimension your customers value, that dimension IS your segment.

### War Story 3 — The $8M Product Nobody Paid For
**Symptom:** A funded startup built an AI-powered analytics platform over 18 months. At launch, they had 3 free users and zero paid customers. The "10 companies in the pipeline" turned out to be 10 companies that said "interesting, but not this quarter."
**Root cause:** The founding team mistook feature requests from friendly advisors for validated demand. No one had signed a letter of intent, paid a deposit, or committed a budget line item before the build.
**Fix:** Implemented a "5 paid pilots before code" policy: any new product initiative required 5 signed pilot agreements with real budgets before the first line of code. This killed 4 of 5 proposed features — and made the survivor wildly successful.
**Lesson:** "I'd buy that" is not a signal. "Here's my credit card" is. Run willingness-to-pay tests before building. A $10K validation sprint is cheaper than a $2M product that nobody uses.


## Error Decoder
<!-- DEEP: 10+min -->

| Symptom | Root Cause | Fix | Lesson |
|---------|-----------|-----|--------|
| Market timing wrong | Product launched too early (no demand) or too late (crowded) | Run demand validation with 10+ paid pre-orders before building; use Wardley Map to time your entry | Timing is a feature. Wardley Maps reveal market readiness; pre-orders prove demand. Build when both align. |
| Team can't execute | Key hires missing, wrong incentives, no clear owner | Hire for the next 6 months' problems, not the last 6 months'; DRI model with written OKRs | Hiring for yesterday's crisis creates tomorrow's bloat. One DRI per initiative removes the "I thought someone else was handling it" trap. |
| Runway < 12 months | Burn rate exceeds plan, revenue slower than projected | Cut burn to 18-month runway immediately; model best/worst/realistic case scenarios | Runway is the one number that cannot be negotiated with reality. 18 months gives you negotiating power; 12 is panic mode. |
| Investor pass | Pitch doesn't articulate defensible moat | Lead with TAM → problem → traction → team → ask. Your demo is not your pitch. | Investors bet on monopolies in growing markets. If you can't explain why big companies can't easily copy you, neither can they. |
| Board misalignment | Founder/board disagree on strategy | Pre-board one-on-ones before every board meeting. Surface disagreement in the room, not after. | Board meetings should ratify alignment, not create it. Do the hard conversations in prep calls — the boardroom is for decisions, not discovery. |
| Scaling prematurely | Growing team/features before PMF | Sean Ellis test: < 40% "very disappointed" if product disappeared → do not scale | Growth before PMF multiplies chaos, not revenue. The Sean Ellis test is the cheapest insurance against scaling regret. |
| Co-founder conflict | Roles, equity, or vision disagreement | Written founder agreement with vesting, roles, decision rights, and exit terms | A handshake works until the first hard decision. Written agreements aren't distrust — they're the operating system for co-founder resilience. |


## What Good Looks Like

> You've just completed the business strategy exercise. Your financial model has three defensible scenarios with documented assumptions, not wishful projections. Your TAM/SAM/SOM analysis is grounded in bottom-up data that an investor would trust. The unit economics show LTV/CAC > 3 with a clear path to that ratio from day one. Your GTM plan names specific channels, budgets, and conversion targets — not "social media and word of mouth." Your pricing has been tested with real customers who said "that feels fair" rather than "I'd need to think about it." Every number in your model traces back to a customer conversation or market benchmark.
