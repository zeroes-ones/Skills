## Anti-Rationalization — No Excuses

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---:|
| "We already do code review — adversarial review is redundant." | Standard code review catches 35-45% of defects. Adversarial review catches 65-85%. The gap is where your $500K production incident is hiding right now, passing through your existing process untouched. |
| "I trust this engineer — they've been here 3 years and know the codebase." | Senior engineers insert defects at the same rate as juniors on code they authored. Familiarity bias means they skip the exact edge cases that break. The author's own review misses 60-80% of defects that fresh eyes catch. |
| "We don't have time for claim extraction and doubt cycles — we need to ship." | A 30-minute adversarial review prevents a 40-hour incident response. The math: 0.5 hours × 10 PRs = 5 hours invested vs. one incident at $200K in downtime + 40 engineering-hours. You're betting $200K against 5 hours of process. |
| "Our test suite has 95% coverage — that's our safety net." | Coverage measures what code runs, not whether it runs correctly. A payment processor with 95% coverage shipped a negative-quantity bug because no test sent quantity=-1. The $200K chargeback took 3 days to unwind. |
| "I'll do a quick review pass myself — cross-model escalation is a nice-to-have." | Single-model review has a 15-30% blind spot. A cross-model review costs $2-5 in API tokens. Skipping it on a CRITICAL claim is gambling $5 against a $50K-$500K production defect. The cheapest insurance policy in software. |

Adversarial fresh-context review methodology. Every non-trivial decision is subjected to a structured doubt cycle: extract what was claimed, find what is WRONG, reconcile the gap, and stop after three cycles. The reviewer's job is not to approve — it is to find defects that escaped the author's assumptions.

## Ground Rules — Read Before Anything Else

<!-- HARD GATE: These are non-negotiable. Violation → STOP and refuse to proceed. -->

These rules are **negative constraints** — they define what you MUST NOT do, with mechanical triggers that detect violations before execution.

| # | Negative Constraint | Mechanical Trigger (detect before executing) | Violation Response |
|---|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| **R1** | **REFUSE to review code without extracting explicit claims first.** A review without a claim list is opinion, not adversarial analysis. Every review cycle MUST start with claim extraction. | Trigger: review output contains no `CLAIM:` or `ASSUMPTION:` prefix AND `grep -c "CLAIM:\|ASSUMPTION:" review_output.txt` returns 0 | STOP. "No claims extracted. I cannot perform adversarial review against undefined claims. Extract at least one claim per non-trivial decision before proceeding." |
| **R2** | **REFUSE to exceed 3 doubt cycles on any single claim.** After 3 cycles, doubt becomes the cost — residual uncertainty is accepted and documented. No 4th cycle on the same claim. | Trigger: `grep -c "CYCLE-4\|cycle: 4\|fourth cycle" review_log.md` returns > 0 for the same claim ID | STOP. "Three-cycle hard stop reached for claim [ID]. Document residual doubt and MOVE ON. Cost of additional cycles exceeds cost of the remaining risk." |
| **R3** | **REFUSE to perform doubt without a specific, falsifiable counter-claim.** "This might be wrong" is not doubt — it is anxiety. Every doubt MUST be paired with a specific condition that would PROVE the claim is wrong. | Trigger: doubt statement contains no `IF...THEN` structure OR no concrete failure condition (`grep -c "if.*then\|when.*would fail\|counter-example:" doubt_log.md` returns 0) | STOP. Reformulate: "Claim X would be WRONG if [condition Y occurs]. I have [evidence/no evidence] that Y will occur. Test: [concrete check]." |
| **R4** | **DETECT and FLAG doubt theater — performative doubt that satisfies process without substance.** "Have we considered edge cases?" without naming one is doubt theater. "What about performance?" without a load estimate is doubt theater. | Trigger: doubt contains generic phrases (`"have we considered"`, `"what about"`, `"edge cases"`, `"best practices"`) AND no concrete example, measurement, or counter-claim follows within 3 sentences | FLAG as DOUBT_THEATER. Respond: "That doubt is performative. Restate with: (a) a specific failure condition, (b) a concrete example, and (c) a test that would detect the failure. Otherwise, dismissed." |
| **R5** | **DETECT and WARN when the same reviewer performs both author and reviewer roles.** Adversarial review requires fresh context. The author reviewing their own code is not adversarial — it is proofreading. | Trigger: `git log --format='%an' -1` author matches current reviewer OR `file_author == reviewer` in review metadata | WARN: "Same person authored and reviewed this code. Fresh-context adversarial review is compromised. Escalate to cross-model review or request a second reviewer." |
| **R6** | **DETECT and WARN about claims not traceable to code or specification.** A claim that cannot be verified against source material is unfalsifiable and must be rejected. | Trigger: claim references no file path, line number, spec section, or test case (`grep -c "file:\|line:\|spec:\|test:" claim_list.md` for each claim returns 0) | WARN: "Claim [ID] has no traceability anchor. Add at minimum: file path + line range, spec section reference, or test case ID. Unanchored claims cannot be doubted." |
| **R7** | **REFUSE to reconcile without a decision record.** Reconciliation that produces no artifact is lost knowledge. Every reconciliation MUST produce a RECONCILE.md entry with: claim, doubt, resolution, residual risk, and date. | Trigger: doubt cycle completes AND `grep -c "RESOLVED:\|ACCEPTED_RISK:\|DEFERRED:" reconcile_log.md` shows no new entries since cycle start | STOP. "Reconciliation must produce a decision record. Create RECONCILE.md entry before closing this cycle." |

## The Expert's Mindset

Masters of doubt-driven development don't just review code — they **weaponize fresh perspective against hidden assumptions.** They know that the most expensive bugs live in the gap between what the author *believes* the code does and what the code *actually* does.

| Cognitive Bias | Mitigation |
|----------------|------------|
| **Confirmation bias** — reviewing to confirm the code works, not to find where it fails | Start every review by listing 3 ways this code COULD fail; only then read the code |
| **Anchoring bias** — first claim encountered colors interpretation of all subsequent claims | Randomize claim review order; do not review claims in the order the author listed them |
| **Authority bias** — deferring to the author's expertise ("they know this codebase better than I do") | The reviewer's ignorance IS the methodology — freshness is the advantage, not the weakness |
| **Sunk cost fallacy** — reluctance to challenge decisions already implemented and tested | Implementation effort is irrelevant to correctness; a 3-week feature can still be wrong in line 1 |
| **Groupthink** — assuming prior reviewers caught what you would catch | Assume zero prior review quality; every reviewer starts from scratch with adversarial intent |
| **Overconfidence** — "I would have caught that" after seeing a defect found by someone else | Track your own miss rate; compare what you flagged vs. what others flagged on the same code |

### What Masters Know That Others Don't

- **The shape of assumption failure** — defects cluster around implicit assumptions, not explicit logic errors. The code that "everyone knows works" is where the $500K bug lives.
- **That review quality decays exponentially with familiarity** — the third read of the same file has 60% less defect discovery than the first. Fresh context is the scarce resource.
- **The difference between a doubt that saves money and a doubt that costs money** — substantive doubt finds a specific failure mode with a testable condition. Performative doubt burns cycle budget on anxiety.
- **When to escalate to a different model** — if the same model both generated and reviewed the code, switch to a model with different training data and different failure patterns for the third cycle.

### When to Break Your Own Rules

- **Skip claim extraction for trivial changes** — if the diff is < 20 lines and contains only renaming, formatting, or log-level changes, proceed to quick scan.
- **Accept residual doubt immediately for cosmetic issues** — code formatting, variable naming, and comment clarity are not worth a full doubt cycle.

## Operating at Different Levels

| Level | Scope | You... |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **L1** | Single function or class | Extract claims from a single unit; run 1-2 doubt cycles; flag but don't reconcile |
| **L2** | Feature or pull request | Full CLAIM→EXTRACT→DOUBT→RECONCILE→STOP cycle; produces RECONCILE.md; may escalate one claim to cross-model |
| **L3** | System or architectural decision | Multi-claim extraction across components; cross-model escalation for architectural claims; produces ADR with doubt history |
| **L4** | Product or platform launch | Doubt-driven review gates deployment; residual doubt inventory with quantified risk; cross-model review mandatory |
| **L5** | Organizational practice | Define doubt-driven development standards; train teams on adversarial review; establish cross-model escalation protocols |

**Default level for this skill:** L2
**Usage:** Invoke this skill with your target level, e.g., "as an L3 doubt-driven reviewer, audit this authentication module."

For full level definitions, see `skills/00-framework/skill-levels/SKILL.md`.

## When to Use

<!-- QUICK: 30s -- scan the bullet list to decide if this skill fits -->

- Before merging PRs that touch authentication, authorization, payment, data integrity, or safety-critical paths
- During architectural decision reviews where the cost of being wrong exceeds $10K
- After a production incident — doubt-driven review the fix AND the surrounding code that allowed the defect
- When onboarding to a new codebase where you need to build a defect model quickly
- Before regulatory submission or compliance audit for software with safety implications
- When a junior engineer implements a senior-designed specification — the spec is a claim, the implementation is the test

### When NOT to Use

- Prototypes, spikes, or throwaway code where the cost of review exceeds the cost of defects
- Trivial changes: typos, formatting, log-level adjustments (diff < 20 lines with no logic change)
- Personal projects with zero users and zero downstream dependencies
- When the review cycle budget (time) exceeds the project timeline — use standard code review instead

## Route the Request

<!-- Machine-executable routing: auto-route by artifact detection + Intent Route fallback -->

### Auto-Route (No User Input Required)
Evaluate these file-system conditions in order. First match wins — jump immediately.

| # | Detect Condition | Route To | Intent Route Fallback |
|---|-----------------|----------|----------------------|
| **A1** | `file_contains("*.md", "CLAIM:\|claim_id\|extracted_claim")` AND `file_contains("*.md", "DOUBT:\|doubt_cycle\|counter-claim")` | This is your skill. Jump to **Core Workflow** — Phase 3 (DOUBT). | "I detect existing claims and doubt records — resuming adversarial review." |
| **A2** | `file_exists("RECONCILE.md\|reconcile_log.md")` AND `file_contains("*.md", "RESIDUAL_RISK:\|ACCEPTED:\|cycle: 3")` | This is your skill. Jump to **Core Workflow** — Phase 5 (STOP). | "I detect completed reconciliation with residual risk acceptance — reviewing stop criteria." |
| **A3** | `file_contains("*", "TODO\|FIXME\|HACK\|XXX")` AND `file_contains("*.py\|*.ts\|*.go\|*.java", "auth\|password\|token\|secret\|payment\|encrypt")` | This is your skill. Jump to **Core Workflow** — Phase 1 (CLAIM extraction, security focus). | "I detect TODO markers in security-sensitive code — extracting claims from unaddressed assumptions." |
| **A4** | `file_contains("*.py\|*.ts", "openai\|anthropic\|gemini\|llm\|LLM")` AND `file_contains("*", "system_prompt\|temperature\|max_tokens")` | Invoke **llm-engineer** first, then return here for doubt cycle. LLM pipeline must be understood before claims can be extracted. | "I detect LLM integration code — routing to LLM Engineer for pipeline context, then returning for adversarial review." |
| **A5** | `file_contains("*", "if.*==.*:\|switch.*case")` with > 20 branches AND `file_contains("*", "state_machine\|workflow\|status\|enum")` | This is your skill. Jump to **Decision Trees** — Claim Extraction Depth. Complex branching needs deep claim extraction. | "I detect complex branching logic — routing to deep claim extraction for state machine analysis." |
| **A6** | `file_contains("*.sql\|*.prisma\|*.schema", "migration\|ALTER\|DROP\|schema_change")` AND `file_contains("*", "down\|rollback\|revert")` | Invoke **database-designer** first, then return here. Schema changes need data integrity context. | "I detect database migration with rollback — routing to Database Designer for schema validation, then returning for adversarial review." |
| **A7** | `file_contains("*", "retry\|timeout\|circuit_breaker\|fallback\|bulkhead")` | This is your skill. Jump to **Decision Trees** — Doubt Severity Classification. Resilience code is high-severity by default. | "I detect resilience/resiliency patterns — routing to high-severity doubt classification." |
| **A8** | `file_exists("*.test.*\|*_test.*\|*.spec.*\|test_*")` AND NOT `file_contains("*.test.*", "test.*fail\|test.*error\|test.*edge\|test.*boundary\|property.based\|fuzz")` | This is your skill. Jump to **Core Workflow** — Phase 2 (EXTRACT, test gap claims). | "I detect test files with only happy-path tests — extracting claims about test coverage gaps." |

### Intent Route (Ask the User)
If no auto-route matched, use this intent tree:

```
What are you trying to do?
├── REVIEW a PR or code change with adversarial fresh context → Jump to "Core Workflow" — Phase 1 (CLAIM)
├── AUDIT an existing system for hidden assumptions → Go to "Decision Trees > Claim Extraction Depth" then Phase 1
├── RECONCILE a doubt that was previously raised → Jump to "Core Workflow" — Phase 4 (RECONCILE)
├── DECIDE whether to escalate to cross-model review → Go to "Decision Trees > Cross-Model Escalation Criteria"
├── DETECT whether your team is performing doubt theater → Go to "Decision Trees > Doubt Theater Detection"
├── CALCULATE whether doubt-driven development is worth the cost → Open `(../references/cost-of-defects-calculator.md)`
├── Review is for a prototype or throwaway code → Invoke **code-reviewer** instead (standard review, not adversarial)
└── Not sure where to start? → Start at "Ground Rules" then "When to Use"
```

### Phase 1: CLAIM — Extract Every Non-Trivial Assumption

Read the code as if the author is trying to deceive you. Every line that makes an assertion about behavior, data, timing, or correctness IS a claim.

**What qualifies as a claim:**
- Behavior assertions: "This function returns sorted results" (Is it? Under all inputs?)
- Invariant assertions: "This value is never null here" (Prove it.)
- Security assertions: "Only authenticated users reach this handler" (Where's the middleware?)
- Performance assertions: "This query runs in O(n)" (What's n at scale?)
- Correctness assertions: "This matches the spec" (Which spec? Which version?)

```
Example: Extracting claims from an auth middleware

function requireAuth(req, res, next) {          // CLAIM-001: Every route after this
  const token = req.headers.authorization;      // middleware has a valid token.
  if (!token) return res.status(401);           // CLAIM-002: Absence of token → 401.
  const decoded = jwt.verify(token, SECRET);    // CLAIM-003: jwt.verify rejects
  req.user = decoded;                           // expired/invalid tokens.
  next();                                       // CLAIM-004: decoded payload is
}                                               // safe to attach as req.user.
                                                // CLAIM-005: next() is always
                                                // called after successful auth.
```

**Output artifact:** `claims.md` with each claim labeled `CLAIM-NNN`, the code location (file:line), and the extracted assertion in one sentence.

### Phase 2: EXTRACT — Anchor Every Claim

For each claim, find the evidence that would PROVE or DISPROVE it. A claim without a test is a confession, not a claim.

```
Example: Anchoring CLAIM-002

CLAIM-002: Absence of token → 401.
  Evidence FOR:
    - auth.test.ts:45 — sends request without Authorization header, expects 401 ✓
    - auth.test.ts:52 — sends request with empty Authorization header, expects 401 ✓
  Evidence AGAINST:
    - No test for Authorization header with value "null" (string) ❌
    - No test for Authorization header with value "undefined" (string) ❌
    - No test for malformed Bearer prefix ("Bearer" vs "bearer" vs empty scheme) ❌
```

**Output artifact:** `anchored_claims.md` — same claims, now with evidence columns (FOR/AGAINST) and at least one testable condition per claim.

### Phase 3: DOUBT — Adversarial Challenge (Max 3 Cycles)

For each anchored claim, adopt the mindset: **"This claim is false. Find the proof."**

Each doubt cycle MUST follow this structure:
```
DOUBT-[claim_id]-[cycle]: "Claim X would be WRONG if [condition]."
  TEST: [concrete check that verifies condition]
  EVIDENCE: [grep/run/test result]
  SEVERITY: [CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW] — if condition is met, what's the blast radius?
```

```
Example: Doubt cycle on CLAIM-002

CYCLE 1:
  DOUBT-C002-1: "CLAIM-002 would be WRONG if the Authorization header
                 can contain the literal string 'null' when JS null
                 is coerced to a string."
  TEST: curl -H "Authorization: null" https://api/secure-endpoint
  EVIDENCE: Returns 401 ✓ (express does not coerce null to "null" header)
  SEVERITY: HIGH (would allow unauthenticated access)
  DISPOSITION: CLAIM HOLDS for this condition.

CYCLE 2:
  DOUBT-C002-2: "CLAIM-002 would be WRONG if jwt.verify throws
                 instead of returning null on invalid token."
  TEST: grep -n "try.*catch\|\.catch" auth.js
  EVIDENCE: No try/catch around jwt.verify — unhandled rejection! ❌
  SEVERITY: CRITICAL (crash loop on any invalid token)
  DISPOSITION: CLAIM FAILS. jwt.verify throws JsonWebTokenError.
                → RECONCILE required.
```

**Cycle limit:** Maximum 3 cycles per claim. After cycle 3, residual doubt is documented and accepted.

### Phase 4: RECONCILE — Resolve, Accept, or Escalate

Every doubt that does not resolve to "CLAIM HOLDS" must be reconciled. Three outcomes:

```
RECONCILE-[claim_id]:
  RESOLVED:   [Code fix applied, test added → claim now holds]
  ACCEPTED:   [Risk accepted with documented rationale and monitoring plan]
  ESCALATED:  [Cross-model review requested — see cross-model-escalation.md]
```

```
Example: Reconciling DOUBT-C002-2

RECONCILE-C002:
  STATUS: RESOLVED
  DOUBT: jwt.verify throws instead of returning null
  FIX: Wrapped jwt.verify in try/catch with explicit JsonWebTokenError handling
  TEST_ADDED: auth.test.ts:78 — sends token with invalid signature, expects 401 not 500
  VERIFIED_BY: CI run #2847 — auth test suite passes with new test
  DATE: 2026-07-23
  REVIEWER: cross-model (GPT-4o verified fix completeness)
```

### Phase 5: STOP — Hard Stop and Residual Doubt Acceptance

After reconciliation, the cycle STOPS. No further doubt on reconciled claims.

**Stop criteria checklist:**
- [ ] All claims have completed at least 1 doubt cycle
- [ ] All CRITICAL/HIGH severity doubts are RESOLVED (not ACCEPTED)
- [ ] No claim has exceeded 3 doubt cycles
- [ ] RECONCILE.md contains entries for every non-HOLDS doubt
- [ ] Residual risk inventory is complete with monitoring plan
- [ ] Cross-model escalation considered for any CRITICAL doubt that required cycle 3

```
Example: STOP artifact

STOP REPORT — 2026-07-23 — PR #847 (Auth Middleware Refactor)
  CLAIMS EXTRACTED:  12
  DOUBT CYCLES RUN:  28 (across 12 claims)
  CLAIMS HOLDING:    8
  RECONCILED:        4 (3 RESOLVED, 1 ACCEPTED, 0 ESCALATED)
  RESIDUAL RISK:     1 — CLAIM-009 (rate limiting assumes single-instance;
                      accepted with monitoring alert on >1000 req/s per IP)
  STOP DECISION:     CLEAR TO MERGE with residual risk monitoring active.
```

```

**Phase 2 — Doubt Intensity Calibration:**
- **FULL cycle:** Extract ALL claims (expect 8-15 claims per 200-line PR). Run all 3 cycles on CRITICAL/HIGH claims, 1-2 cycles on MEDIUM, skip LOW.
- **Quick doubt:** Extract only top-3 highest-impact claims. Run 1 cycle each. Hard stop.
- **Standard review:** Conventional code review (invoke `code-reviewer`). No adversarial stance.

**Phase 2 — Extraction Rules by Depth:**
- **DEEP:** Minimum 1 claim per function, 1 per invariant, 1 per error path, 1 per timing/ordering assumption, 1 per trust boundary crossing.
- **MEDIUM:** Minimum 1 claim per data mutation, 1 per rollback/recovery path, 1 per concurrent access pattern.
- **SHALLOW:** 1 claim per public function behavior. Internal invariants assumed correct unless obviously broken.

**Phase 2 — Model Pairing Guide:**
- **Code generated by Claude, review with GPT-4o** (or vice versa) — different training data, different blind spots.
- **Architectural reasoning:** Claude Opus for depth, GPT-4o for breadth and edge-case enumeration.
- **Security claims:** Always cross-model. No single model catches all injection vectors.
- **LLM-output claims:** If code handles LLM output, review with a model DIFFERENT from the one generating that output.
- **Escalation artifact:** Create `escalation-[claim_id].md` with both model outputs, diff of findings, and final reconciliation.

**Phase 2 — Doubt Theater Patterns (memorize these):**

| Theater Pattern | Example | Why It's Performative |
|-----------------|---------|----------------------|
| **The Generic Edge Case** | "Have we considered edge cases?" | Names no edge case. No condition to test. |
| **The Performance Ghost** | "What about performance at scale?" | No load estimate, no bottleneck hypothesis, no profiling target. |
| **The Security Blanket** | "Is this secure?" | No threat model, no attack vector, no OWASP category. |
| **The Best Practice Appeal** | "This doesn't follow best practices." | No specific practice cited, no explanation of what breaks. |
| **The Future Anxiety** | "What if requirements change?" | No scenario, no fragility assessment, no concrete risk. |
| **The Testing Platitude** | "We should add more tests." | No specific untested path, no property to verify, no coverage gap identified. |

**Response template for doubt theater:**

## Cross-Skill Coordination

<!-- STANDARD: 3min -->

<!-- NEIGHBORS: Skills this doubt-driven reviewer coordinates with — adversarial findings cascade across teams -->

| Upstream Skill | What You Receive | Decision Gate |
|---|---|---|
| `code-reviewer` | Standard code review output, identified issues, style violations, complexity warnings | Promote issues that were flagged but not resolved; escalate "won't fix" decisions on critical paths to full doubt cycle |
| `security-reviewer` | STRIDE threat model, OWASP classification, vulnerability report, CVSS scores | If security reviewer found nothing on a security-sensitive change → doubt that claim. Run adversarial security doubt cycle. |
| `system-architect` | ADRs, architecture diagrams, component boundaries, data flow maps | Extract claims from every architectural assumption (sync vs async, consistency model, failure domain boundary) |
| `qa-engineer` | Test strategy, coverage reports, test case inventory, property-based test results | Map test gaps to claims. Every untested invariant is a claim that needs a doubt cycle. |

| Downstream Skill | What You Provide | Artifacts |
|---|---|---|
| `code-reviewer` | Doubt-driven findings that require code changes; reconciled claims with fix recommendations | RECONCILE.md entries marked RESOLVED with required code changes |
| `security-reviewer` | Security claims that survived adversarial doubt; residual security risks accepted with rationale | Escalation reports for security doubts that cross-model review flagged |
| `incident-responder` | Pre-identified failure modes with monitoring conditions; residual risk inventory | STOP report with residual risk catalog and detection conditions |
| `release-manager` | Go/no-go recommendation with quantified residual risk; claims inventory | STOP decision with merge gate status and accepted-risk summary |
| `compliance-officer` | Audit trail of doubt cycles; traceability from claim → doubt → reconciliation → residual risk | Full RECONCILE.md with chain of custody for every safety-critical claim |

**Coordination cadence:**
- **Per PR:** Doubt cycle output feeds `code-reviewer` for final approval gate
- **Per sprint:** Residual risk review with `system-architect` — are accepted risks accumulating in one component?
- **Per incident:** Postmortem doubt cycle — extract claims from the fix AND the surrounding code; feed to `incident-responder`
- **Per release:** STOP report feeds `release-manager` go/no-go decision
- **Quarterly:** Cross-model escalation audit — which model pairs found what the other missed?

## Proactive Triggers

<!-- These conditions fire automatically — no user invocation needed -->

| Trigger Condition | Action | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| `git diff --stat` shows > 200 lines changed in a single PR touching `auth*`, `pay*`, `crypt*`, or `health*` paths | Auto-invoke full doubt cycle (all 5 phases) | Large diffs in critical paths have the highest defect density; adversarial review is mandatory |
| Production incident resolved in last 24 hours AND incident tagged `sev1` or `sev0` | Auto-invoke doubt cycle on incident fix + surrounding 200 lines of unchanged code | Incidents cluster; the fix often reveals assumptions that adjacent code also depends on |
| `file_contains("*", "FIXME\|HACK\|XXX\|WORKAROUND")` AND `file_contains("*.py\|*.ts", "auth\|token\|secret\|password")` | Auto-invoke Phase 1 (CLAIM extraction) with security focus | Workarounds in security code are pre-acknowledged defects; each is a claim that needs doubt |
| Dependency major version bump (semver) in package.json/requirements.txt/go.mod | Auto-invoke Phase 2 (EXTRACT) on changelog claims vs actual code changes | Major version bumps introduce breaking changes that semantic versioning claims are documented; doubt those claims |
| `git log --oneline -10` shows > 5 commits by same author on same file without review | Auto-invoke adversarial review on entire file | Solo-authored code with no review history has the highest density of unchallenged assumptions |
| Database migration file contains `DROP COLUMN`, `DROP TABLE`, or `TRUNCATE` | Auto-invoke full doubt cycle with `database-designer` coordination | Irreversible data operations need adversarial verification of rollback plan and data integrity |
| New file added to `middleware/`, `guard/`, `filter/`, or `interceptor/` directory | Auto-invoke Phase 1 on trust boundary claims | New middleware sits on the request path; every request passes through its assumptions |

## What Good Looks Like

### Before (Standard Review)
```
Reviewer: "LGTM! Code looks clean. Nice use of async/await.
          Minor nit: consider extracting the token parsing
          to a helper function."

Problems:
- Zero claims extracted — reviewer approved based on style, not correctness
- Token parsing "nit" was actually a security boundary where jwt.verify
  threw unhandled exceptions → 500 errors in production
- No adversarial stance — reviewer confirmed what they expected to see
- No doubt cycles run — zero defects found because zero doubts raised
```

### After (Doubt-Driven Review)
```
Reviewer: "CLAIM-002: Absence of token → 401.
          DOUBT-C002-2: Would be wrong if jwt.verify throws.
          TEST: grep -n 'try.*catch' auth.js → 0 results.
          SEVERITY: CRITICAL (unhandled rejection → crash loop).
          RECONCILE-C002: RESOLVED. Wrapped in try/catch.
          Test added: auth.test.ts:78.

          CLAIM-005: next() always called after successful auth.
          DOUBT-C005-1: Would be wrong if async error in
          subsequent handler causes uncaught rejection.
          TEST: curl with handler that throws async → 500.
          SEVERITY: HIGH.
          RECONCILE-C005: RESOLVED. Added error boundary.

          12 claims, 28 doubt cycles, 4 reconciled, 0 accepted
          without resolution. CLEAR TO MERGE."

Improvements:
- Claim extracted from every non-trivial assertion
- Concrete test condition for every doubt
- Both defects would have reached production under standard review
- Full audit trail from claim → doubt → reconciliation
```

## Deliberate Practice

<!-- Build adversarial review intuition through structured repetition -->

### Exercise 1: Claim Extraction Sprint (15 min)
Take a 50-line function you wrote last week. Set a timer for 5 minutes. Extract every claim — behavior assertions, invariant assumptions, security boundaries, timing assumptions. Aim for 8+ claims. Then verify: for each claim, can you write a test that disproves it?

### Exercise 2: Doubt Theater Self-Audit (10 min)
Review your last 5 code review comments. Classify each as SUBSTANTIVE or DOUBT_THEATER using the detection tree. How many were performative? For each theater comment, reformulate as a specific, falsifiable doubt.

### Exercise 3: Cross-Model Blind Spot Discovery (20 min)
Take a 100-line PR. Have Claude extract claims. Have GPT-4o run doubt cycles on those claims. Compare: which claims did each model miss? Which doubts did one model raise that the other didn't? Document the blind spot pattern.

### Exercise 4: 3-Cycle Constraint Drill (15 min)
Pick a claim from your codebase. Run exactly 3 doubt cycles on it. After cycle 3, STOP — even if you think of a 4th doubt. Write the residual risk acceptance: "After 3 cycles, residual risk is [X]. Monitoring: [Y]. Accept because [Z]." Practice the discipline of stopping.

### Exercise 5: Adversarial Pairing (30 min)
Pair with a teammate. You review their code adversarially; they review yours. Rule: you may ONLY state doubts in the form "This claim is wrong if [condition]." No opinions, no style comments, no "have you considered." Count substantive doubts found. Compare to your solo review rate.

## Gotchas

- **The false confidence of passing tests.** A test suite with 95% coverage that only tests happy paths proves nothing. Every test is a claim that the code behaves correctly under that input. Doubt every test that doesn't include: null input, boundary value, concurrent access, timeout, and error propagation. A $200K payment processing bug at a major retailer passed all unit tests because no test sent a negative quantity. **Total cost: $150K-$500K per incident in refund processing, audit overhead, and reputation damage. Fix: add property-based testing for every CRITICAL claim.**

- **The cost of doubt theater in meetings.** A team of 5 senior engineers spending 30 minutes per PR on performative doubt ("have we considered edge cases?") across 10 PRs per sprint wastes 2.5 engineer-hours per sprint on theater. At $150/hr fully loaded, that's $375/sprint, $9,750/quarter in pure process waste — with zero defects actually found. **Total cost: $30K-$50K/year in wasted engineering time for a mid-size team. Fix: implement the Doubt Theater Detection tree as a pre-filter before any doubt is discussed.**

- **The "reviewed by author" blind spot.** When the same person who wrote the code marks it as reviewed, defect discovery drops 60-80% compared to fresh-context review. A startup lost $85K in AWS charges over a weekend when an author-reviewed infinite retry loop shipped to production — the author "knew" the retry logic was bounded because they wrote it, but the code had no max-retry guard. **Total cost: $50K-$200K per incident in cloud overage, downtime, and emergency fix deployment. Fix: enforce R5 mechanically — git hook that blocks self-review on critical paths.**

- **The escalating cost of unreconciled doubt.** Each unreconciled doubt that is "deferred to next sprint" becomes an invisible tax. After 3 sprints of deferral, the doubt is forgotten, the original reviewer has moved on, and the code is now depended upon by 4 other modules. Fixing it then costs 3-8x the original fix cost due to ripple effects. A fintech company spent $120K refactoring a transaction engine because a concurrency doubt deferred in sprint 3 became a cascade failure in sprint 12. **Total cost: $60K-$250K per deferred doubt that becomes a production incident, in refactoring, downtime, and lost engineering trust. Fix: RECONCILE.md entries auto-escalate if unresolved after 2 sprints.**

- **Cross-model review: the $5K insurance policy.** A single cross-model review (Claude → GPT-4o or vice versa) costs ~$2-5 in API tokens and 10 minutes of engineer time. It catches defects that single-model review misses 15-30% of the time. Skipping cross-model review on a CRITICAL claim that reaches cycle 3 is gambling $5 against the $50K-$500K cost of a production defect. An e-commerce platform skipped cross-model review on a checkout flow claim — the bug (race condition in inventory deduction) cost $340K in oversold inventory and customer compensation. **Total cost: $50K-$500K per missed cross-model opportunity on CRITICAL claims. Fix: cross-model escalation is mandatory at cycle 3 for CRITICAL severity.**

- **The "quiet acceptance" anti-pattern.** When a reviewer lacks confidence to challenge a senior engineer's code, they silently ACCEPT doubts without resolution. This is deference, not reconciliation. A medical device software team had 14 ACCEPTED doubts on a drug-dosage calculation module over 6 months — 3 of those doubts became actual patient-safety incidents. The FDA 483 observation cost $180K in remediation and delayed product launch by 4 months. **Total cost: $100K-$500K in regulatory remediation, launch delays, and potential liability. Fix: ACCEPTED doubts on safety-critical paths require a second reviewer's sign-off — never single-reviewer acceptance.**

- **The trust decay curve.** Every time a doubt-driven review finds a defect that standard review missed, team trust in standard review erodes. After 5 such incidents, engineers start running informal doubt cycles on every PR regardless of criticality — burning 40% more review time with no process guardrails. Without formal doubt-driven development, you get the cost of adversarial review without the structure. **Total cost: $80K-$200K/year in stealth process overhead for a 10-engineer team. Fix: formalize doubt-driven development as an explicit, opt-in process; don't let it become a shadow process.**

## Verification

<!-- Run this checklist before marking any doubt cycle complete -->

- [ ] **Ground Rules:** All 7 ground rules checked. No violations unaddressed. Run `grep -c "DOUBT_THEATER" doubt_log.md` — each flag must have a reformulation or dismissal note.
- [ ] **Claims extracted:** Every non-trivial decision in the diff has at least 1 claim. Run `grep -c "CLAIM-" claims.md` — count should exceed number of functions changed.
- [ ] **Claims anchored:** Every claim has file:line, test reference, or spec section. Run `grep -c "file:\|line:\|spec:\|test:" claims.md` — count must equal total claims.
- [ ] **Doubt cycles:** No claim exceeded 3 cycles. Run `grep -c "CYCLE-4\|cycle: 4" doubt_log.md` — must return 0.
- [ ] **Doubt theater filtered:** All doubts are substantive (specific failure condition + test). Run `grep -c "have we considered\|what about\|edge cases\|best practices" doubt_log.md` — each hit must have a resolution note within 3 lines.
- [ ] **Critical reconciled:** All CRITICAL severity doubts have RESOLVED status. Run `grep "CRITICAL" doubt_log.md | grep -v "RESOLVED"` — must return 0.
- [ ] **Residual risk documented:** Every ACCEPTED doubt has a monitoring plan with alert configuration. Run `grep "ACCEPTED" RECONCILE.md | grep -v "monitoring\|alert\|runbook"` — must return 0.
- [ ] **Cross-model considered:** Every CRITICAL doubt that reached cycle 3 has an escalation record. Run `grep "CRITICAL.*cycle: 3" doubt_log.md | grep -v "escalat"` — must return 0.
- [ ] **STOP report complete:** All phases produce output artifacts. RECONCILE.md has entries for every non-HOLDS doubt.
- [ ] **Verification script passes:** Run `scripts/verify-skill.sh`. All checks must pass.
